<p class="chap">THE POWER OF THOUGHT</p>


<p>In other volumes of this series we have
considered the operations of the human mind
known as Will, Memory, etc. We now approach
the consideration of those mental activities
which are concerned with the phenomena
of <i>thought</i>&mdash;those activities which we
generally speak of as the operation of the intellect
or reason.</p>

<p>What is thought? The answer is not an
easy one, although we use the term familiarly
almost every hour of our waking existence.
The dictionaries define the term "Thought"
as follows: "The act of thinking; the exercise
of the mind in any way except sense and
perception; serious consideration; deliberation;
reflection; the power or faculty of
thinking; the mental faculty of the mind;
etc." This drives us back upon the term, "to
think" which is defined as follows: "To occupy
the mind on some subject; to have
ideas; to revolve ideas in the mind; to cogi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>tate;
to reason; to exercise the power of
thought; to have a succession of ideas or
mental states; to perform any mental operation,
whether of apprehension, judgment, or
illation; to judge; to form a conclusion, to
determine; etc."</p>

<p>Thought is an operation of the intellect.
The intellect is: "that faculty of the human
soul or mind by which it receives or comprehends
the ideas communicated to it by the
senses or by perception, or other means, as
distinguished from the power to feel and to
will; the power or faculty to perceive objects
in their relations; the power to judge and
comprehend; also the capacity for higher
forms of knowledge as distinguished from
the power to perceive and imagine."</p>

<p>When we say what we "think," we mean
that we exercise the faculties whereby we
compare and contrast certain things with
other things, observing and noting their
points of difference and agreement, then
classifying them in accordance with these
observed agreements and differences. In
<i>thinking</i> we tend to classify the multitude of
impressions received from the outside world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
arranging thousands of objects into one general
class, and other thousands into other general
classes, and then sub-dividing these
classes, until finally we have found mental
pigeon-holes for every conceivable idea or impression.
We then begin to make inferences
and deductions regarding these ideas or impressions,
working from the known to the
unknown, from particulars to generalities, or
from generalities to particulars, as the case
may be.</p>

<p>It is this faculty or power of thought&mdash;this
use of the intellect, that has brought man
to his present high position in the world of
living things. In his early days, man was a
much weaker animal than those with whom
he was brought into contact. The tigers, lions,
bears, mammoths, and other ferocious beasts
were much stronger, fiercer, and fleeter than
man, and he was placed in a position so lacking
of apparent equal chance of survival,
that an observer would have unhesitatingly
advanced the opinion that this weak, feeble,
slow animal must soon surely perish in the
struggle for existence, and that the "survival
of the fittest" would soon cause him to vanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
from the scene of the world's activities. And,
so it would have been had he possessed no
equipment other than those of the other animals;
viz., strength, natural weapons and
speed. And yet man not only survived in
spite of these disadvantages, but he has actually
conquered, mastered and enslaved these
other animals which seemed likely to work
his destruction. Why? How?</p>

<p>This feeble animal called <i>man</i> had within
him the elements of a new power&mdash;a power
manifested in but a slight degree in the other
animals. He possessed an intellect by which
he was able to deduce, compare, infer&mdash;reason.</p>

<p>His lack of natural weapons he overcame
by borrowing the idea of the tooth and claw
of the other animals, imitating them in flint
and shaping them into spears; borrowing the
trunk of the elephant and the paw of the tiger,
and reproducing their blow-striking qualities
in his wooden club. Not only this but he took
lessons from the supple limbs and branches
of the trees, and copied the principle in his
bow, in order to project its minature spear,
his arrow. He sheltered himself, his mate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and his young, from the fury of the storm,
first by caves and afterwards by rude houses,
built in inaccessible places, reached only by
means of crude ladders, bridges, or climbing
poles. He built doors for his habitations, to
protect himself from the attacks of these wild
enemies&mdash;he heaped stones at the mouth of his
caves to keep them out. He placed great
boulders on cliffs that he might topple them
down on the approaching foe. He learned to
hurl rocks with sure aim with his strong arm.
He copied the floating log, and built his first
rude rafts, and then evolved the hollowed
canoe. He used the skins of animals to keep
him warm&mdash;their tendons for his bowstrings.
He learned the advantages of cooperation
and combined effort, and thus formed the first
rudiments of society and social life. And
finally&mdash;man's first great discovery&mdash;he
found the art of fire making.</p>

<p>As a writer has said: "For some hundreds
of years, upon the general plane of self-consciousness,
an ascent, to the human eye gradual
but from the point of view of cosmic
evolution rapid, has been made. In a race
large-brained, walking-erect, gregarious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
brutal, but king of all other brutes, man in
appearance but not in fact, was from the
highest simple-consciousness born the basic
human faculty, self-consciousness and its
twin, language. From these and what went
with these, through suffering, toil and war;
through bestiality, savagery, barbarism;
through slavery, greed, effort, through conquests
infinite, through defeats overwhelming,
through struggle unending; through ages
of aimless semi-brutal existence, through subsistence
on berries and roots; through the use
of the casually found stone or stick; through
life in deep forests, with nuts and seeds, and
on the shores of waters with mollusks, crustaceans
and fish for food; through that greatest,
perhaps, of human victories, the domestication
and subjugation of fire; through the
invention and art of bow and arrow; through
the training of animals and the breaking of
them to labor; through the long learning
which led to the cultivation of the soil;
through the adobe brick and the building of
houses therefrom; through the smelting of
metals and the slow birth of the arts which
rest upon these; through the slow making of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
alphabets and the evolution of the written
work; in short, through thousands of centuries
of human life, of human aspiration,
of human growth, sprang the world of men
and women as it stands before us and within
us today with all its achievements and possessions."</p>

<p>The great difference between thought as
we find it in man, and its forms among the
lower animals lies in what psychologists have
called "progressive thought." The animals
advance but little in their thinking processes
but rest content with those of their ancestors&mdash;their
thought seems to have become set or
crystallized during the process of their evolution.
The birds, mammals and the insects
vary but little in their mental processes from
their ancestors of many thousand years ago.
They build their nests, or dens, in almost precisely
the same manner as did their progenitors
in the stone-age. But man has slowly
but steadily progressed, in spite of temporary
set-backs and failures. He has endeavored
to progress and improve. Those tribes which
fell back in regard to mental progress and
advancement, have been left behind in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
race, and in many cases have become extinct.
The great natural law of the "survival of the
fittest" has steadily operated in the life of
the race. The "fittest" were those best
adapted to grapple with and overcome the
obstacles of their environment, and these
obstacles were best overcome by the use of
the intellect. Those tribes and those individuals
whose intellect was active, tended to survive
where others perished, and consequently
they were able to transmit their intellectual
quality to their descendants.</p>

<p>Halleck says: "Nature is constantly using
her power to kill off the thoughtless, or to
cripple them in life's race. She is determined
that only the fittest and the descendants of
the fittest shall survive. By the 'fittest' she
means those who have thought and whose ancestors
have thought and profited thereby.
Geologists tell us that ages ago there lived in
England bears, tigers, elephants, lions and
many other powerful and fierce animals.
There was living contemporaneous with them
a much weaker animal, that had neither the
claws, the strength, nor the speed of the
tiger. In fact this human being was al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>most
defenceless. Had a being from another
planet been asked to prophesy, he
would undoubtedly have said that this helpless
animal would be the first to be exterminated.
And yet every one of those fierce
creatures succumbed either to the change of
climate, or to man's inferior strength. The
reason was that man had one resource denied
to the animals&mdash;the power of progressive
thought. The land sank, the sea cut off England
from the mainland, the climate changed,
and even the strongest animals were helpless.
But man changed his clothing with the changing
climate. He made fires; he built a retreat
to keep off death by cold. He thought out
means to kill or to subdue the strongest animals.
Had the lions, tigers or bears the power
of progressive thought, they could have combined,
and it would have been possible for
them to exterminate man before he reached
the civilized stage.... Man no longer
sleeps in caves. The smoke no longer fills his
home or finds its way out through the chinks
in the walls or a hole in the roof. In traveling,
he is no longer restricted to his feet or even
to horses. For all this improvement man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
indebted to <i>thought</i>. That has harnessed the
very vibrations of the ether to do his bidding."</p>

<p>And thus we see that man owes his present
place on earth to his Thought-Culture. And,
it certainly behooves us to closely consider
and study the methods and processes whereby
each and every man may cultivate and develop
the wondrous faculties of the mind
which are employed in the processes of
Thought. The faculties of the Mind, like the
muscles of the body, may be developed, trained
and cultivated. The process of such mental
development is called "<span class="smcap">Thought-Culture</span>,"
and forms the subject of this book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE NATURE OF THOUGHT</p>


<p>It was formerly considered necessary for all
books on the subject of thought to begin by
a recital of the metaphysical conceptions regarding
the nature and "thingness" of Mind.
The student was led through many pages and
endless speculation regarding the metaphysical
theories regarding the origin and inner
nature of Mind which, so far from establishing
a fixed and definite explanation in his
mind, rather tended toward confusing him
and giving him the idea that psychology was
of necessity a speculative science lacking
the firm practical basis possessed by other
branches of science. In the end, in the words
of old Omar, he "came out the door through
which he went."</p>

<p>But this tendency has been overcome of late
years, and writers on the subject pass by all
metaphysical conceptions regarding the nature
of Mind, and usually begin by plunging
at once into the real business of psychology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>&mdash;the
business of the practical study of the
mechanism and activities of the mind itself.
As some writer has said, psychology has no
more concern with the solution of the eternal
riddle of "What is Mind?" than physics with
the twin-riddle of "What is Matter?" Both
riddles, and their answers, belong to entirely
different branches and fields of thought than
those concerned with their laws of operation
and principles of activity. As Halleck says:
"Psychology studies the phenomena of mind,
just as physics investigates those of matter."
And, likewise, just as the science of physics
holds true in spite of the varying and changing
conceptions regarding the nature of matter,
so does the science of psychology hold
true in spite of the varying and changing conceptions
regarding the nature of Mind.</p>

<p>Halleck has well said: "If a materialist
should hold that the mind was nothing but
the brain, and that the brain was a vast aggregation
of molecular sheep herding together
in various ways, his hypothesis would
not change the fact that sensation must precede
perception, memory and thought; nor
would the laws of the association of ideas be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
changed, nor would the fact that interest and
repetition aid memory cease to hold good.
The man who thought his mind was a collection
of little cells would dream, imagine, think
and feel; so also would he who believed his
mind to be immaterial. It is very fortunate
that the same mental phenomena occur, no
matter what theory is adopted. Those who
like to study the puzzles as to what mind and
matter really are must go to metaphysics.
Should we ever find that salt, arsenic and all
things else are the same substance with a different
molecular arrangement, we should still
not use them interchangeably."</p>

<p>For the purposes of the study of practical
psychology, we may as well lay aside, if even
for the moment, our pet metaphysical conceptions
and act as if we knew nothing of the
essential nature of Mind (and indeed Science
in truth does <i>not</i> know), and confine ourselves
to the phenomena and manifestations
of Mind which, after all, is the only way in
which and by which we can know anything at
all about it. As Brooks says: "The mind can
be defined only by its activities and manifestations.
In order to obtain a definition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
mind, therefore, we must observe and determine
its various forms of activity. These
activities, classified under a few general heads
and predicated of the unseen something which
manifests them, will give us a definition of
mind."</p>

<p>The act of consciousness determines the
existence of Mind in the person experiencing
it. No one can be conscious of thought and,
at the same time, deny the existence of mind
within himself. For the very act of denial, in
itself, is a manifestation of thought and consequently
an assertion of the existence of
mind. One may assert the axiom: "I think,
therefore, I have a mind;" but he is denied
the privilege of arguing: "I think, therefore,
I have no mind." The mind has an ultimate
and final knowledge of its own existence.</p>

<p>The older view of Mind is that it is a something
higher than matter which it uses for its
manifestation. It was held to be unknowable
in itself and to be studied only through its
manifestations. It was supposed to involve
itself, to become involved, in some way in
matter and to there manifest itself in an infinitude
of forms, degrees, and variations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
The materialistic view, which arose into prominence
in the middle of the Nineteenth Century,
held, on the contrary, that Mind was
merely an activity or property of Matter&mdash;a
function of matter akin to extension and motion.
Huxley, voicing this conception said:
"We have no knowledge of any thinking substance
apart from an extended substance....
We shall, sooner or later, arrive at a mechanical
equivalent of consciousness, just as
we have arrived at a mechanical equivalent of
heat." But, Huxley, himself, was afterwards
constrained to acknowledge that: "How it is
that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness
comes about by the result of irritating
nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as
the appearance of the <i>jinnee</i> when Aladdin
rubbed his lamp."</p>

<p>The most advanced authorities of the day,
are inclined to the opinion that both Matter
and Mind are both differing aspects of some
one fundamental Something; or, as some of
the closest thinkers state it, both are probably
two apparently differing manifestations or
emanations of an Underlying Something
which, as Spencer says: "transcends not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
our reason but also our imagination." The
study of philosophy and metaphysics serves
an important purpose in showing us <i>how much
we do not know</i>, and why we do not know&mdash;also
in showing us the fallacy of many things
we had thought we did know&mdash;but when it
comes to telling us the real "why," actual
cause, or essential nature of <i>anything</i>, it is
largely a disappointment to those who seek
fundamental truths and ultimate reasons. It
is much more comfortable to "abjure the
'Why' and seek the 'How'"&mdash;if we can.</p>

<p>Many psychologists classify the activities
of the mind into three general divisions; <i>viz.</i>,
(1) Thinking; (2) Willing; (3) Feeling.
These divisions, which result from what is
known as "the tri-logical classification," were
first distinctly enunciated by Upham although
Kant had intimated it very plainly. For many
years before the favored division was but two-fold
the line of division being between the <i>cognitive</i>,
or knowing, activities, and the <i>conative</i>,
or acting, activities, generally known as the
Understanding and the Will, respectively. It
took a long time before the authorities would
formally recognize the great field of the Feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>ings
as forming a class by themselves and
ranking with the Understanding and the Will.
There are certain sub-divisions and shadings,
which we shall notice as we proceed, some of
which are more or less complex, and which
seem to shade into others. The student is cautioned
against conceiving of the mind as a
thing having several compartments or distinct
divisions. The classification does not indicate
this and is only intended as a convenience in
analyzing and studying the mental activities
and operations. The "I" which feels, thinks
and acts is the same&mdash;one entity.</p>

<p>As Brooks well says: "The mind is a self-conscious
activity and not a mere passivity;
it is a centre of spiritual forces, all resting in
the background of the ego. As a centre of
forces, it stands related to the forces of the
material and spiritual universe and is acted
upon through its susceptibilities by those
forces. As a spiritual activity, it takes the impressions
derived from those forces, works
them up into the organic growth of itself, converts
them into conscious knowledge and uses
these products as means to set other forces
into activity and produce new results. Stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>ing
above nature and superior to its surroundings,
it nevertheless feeds upon nature, as we
may say, and transforms material influences
into spiritual facts akin to its own nature.
Related to the natural world and apparently
originating from it, it yet rises above this natural
world and, with the crown of freedom
upon its brow, rules the natural obedient to its
will."</p>

<p>In this book, while we shall fully and unquestionably
recognize the "tri-logical classification"
of the activities of the Mind into the
divisions of Thinking, Willing and Feeling,
respectively, nevertheless, we shall, for convenience,
use the term "Thought" in its
broadest, widest and most general sense,
as: "The power or faculty of thinking; the
mental faculty; the mind," rather than in its
narrower and particular sense of: "the understanding
or cognitive faculty of the
mind." Accordingly, we shall include the
cultivation of the mental activities known as
Attention, Perception, Imagination, etc., together
with the strictly cognitive faculties,
under the general term of Thought-Culture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="chap">PHASES OF THOUGHT</p>


<p>We have seen that the Mind is that something
within us which Thinks, Feels and
Wills. There are various phases of these
three forms of activity. These phases have
often been called "the faculties of the mind,"
although many authorities decry the use of
this term, holding that it gives an impression
of <i>several parts or divisions</i> of the mind, separate
and distinct from each other, whereas
these phases are merely the several <i>powers or
forms of activity</i> of the Mind. Every manifestation
of mental activity falls under one of
the three before-mentioned general forms,
i.e., Thinking, Feeling and Willing, respectively.
Every manifestation of mental activity
is either that of the Intellect, the Feelings, or
the Will. Let us consider the first of these
three general forms of mental activity&mdash;the
Intellect.</p>

<p>The <i>Intellect</i> is defined as: "That faculty
or phase of the human mind by which it re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ceives
or comprehends the ideas communicated
to it by the senses or by perception, or
other means, as distinguished from the power
to feel and to will; the power or faculty to perceive
objects in their relations; the power to
judge and comprehend; also the capacity for
higher forms of knowledge as distinguished
from the power to perceive and imagine."
The term itself is derived from the Latin term
<i>intellectus</i>, the primary meaning of which is
"to choose between," which primary meaning
will give the true essential meaning of the
term in its present usage; namely, the faculty
or phase of the mind by which we "choose between"
things or by which we <i>decide</i>.</p>

<p>The phase or faculty of Intellect concerns
itself with Thinking, in the particular and
narrower sense of that term. Its products are
<i>thoughts</i>, <i>mental images</i> and <i>ideas</i>. An <i>idea</i>
or <i>mental image</i> is a mental conception of anything,
as for instance our conception which we
express by the terms, <i>man</i>, <i>animal</i>, <i>house</i>, <i>etc.</i>
Sometimes the word <i>idea</i> is used to express
merely the abstract or generalized conception
of the thing, as, for instance, <i>Man</i> in the sense
of "all men;" while <i>mental image</i> is used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the sense of the mental conception of some one
particular thing, as a "<i>a man</i>;" it being held
that no mental image can be had of a generalization.
A <i>thought</i> is held to be a mental product
arising from a combination of two or more
ideas or mental images, as for instance: "A
horse is an animal;" "a man is a biped;" etc.</p>

<p>The Intellect is held to embrace and include
a number of minor phases or faculties, such
as Perception, Understanding, Imagination,
Memory, Reason and Intuition, which are explained
as follows:</p>

<p><i>Perception</i> is that faculty of the Mind which
interprets the material presented to it by the
senses. It is the power whereby we gain our
knowledge of the external world, as reported
to us by the channels of sense. Through Perception
we are able to form ideas and mental
images, which in turn lead to thoughts. The
objects of which we become conscious through
Perception are called <i>percepts</i>, which form the
bases of what we call <i>concepts</i>, or ideas.</p>

<p><i>Understanding</i> is that faculty of the Mind
by the means of which we are able intelligently
to compare the objects presented to it
by Perception, and by which we separate them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
into parts by analysis, or to combine them into
greater classes, or wholes, by synthesis. It
produces ideas, both abstract and general;
also concepts of truths, laws, principles,
causes, etc. There are several sub-phases of
Understanding, which are known as: Abstraction,
Conception or Generalization, or Judgment
and Reasoning, respectively, which are
explained as follows:</p>

<p><i>Abstraction</i> is that faculty of the Mind
which enables it to abstract, or draw off, and
consider apart from an object, a particular
<i>quality</i> or <i>property</i> of an object, thus making
of the quality or property a distinct object of
thought apart from the original object. Thus
are the <i>abstract ideas</i> of <i>sweetness</i>, <i>color</i>,
<i>hardness</i>, <i>courage</i>, <i>beauty</i>, etc., which we have
abstracted or <i>drawn off</i> from their original
associations, either for the purpose of putting
them out of sight and consideration, or else to
view and consider them by themselves. No
one ever tasted "sweetness" although one
may have tasted <i>sweet things</i>; no one ever
saw "red," although one may have seen <i>red
things</i>; no one ever
saw, heard, tasted or felt "courage" in another, although one may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
seen <i>courageous people</i>. Abstract ideas are
merely the mental conception of <i>qualities</i> or
<i>properties</i> divorced from their associated objects
by Abstraction.</p>

<p><i>Conception</i> or Generalization is that faculty
of the Mind by which it forms and groups together
several particular ideas in the form of
<i>a general idea</i>. By the processes of Conception
we form <i>classes</i> or <i>generalizations</i> from
particular ideas arising from our <i>percepts</i>.
First, we <i>perceive</i> things; then we <i>compare</i>
them with each other; then we abstract their
particular qualities, which are not common
to the several objects; then we <i>generalize</i>
them according to their resemblances; then
we <i>name</i> the generalized concept. From these
combined processes we form a Concept, or
<i>general idea</i> of the class of things to which
the particular things belong. Thus from subjecting
a number of cows to this process, we
arrive at the general Concept of "Cow." This
general Concept includes all the qualities and
properties <i>common to all cows</i>, while omitting
those which are not common to the class. Or,
we may form a concept of Napoleon Bonaparte,
by combining his several qualities and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
properties and thus form a <i>general idea</i> of the
man.</p>

<p><i>Judgment</i> is that faculty of the Mind whereby
we determine the agreement or disagreement
between two concepts, ideas, or objects
of thought, by comparing them with each
other. From this comparison arises the judgment,
which is expressed in the shape of a
logical <i>proposition</i>: "The horse is an animal;"
or "the horse is not a cow." Judgment
is also used in forming a concept, in the first
place, for we must <i>compare qualities</i> before
we can form a <i>general idea</i>.</p>

<p><i>Reasoning</i> is that faculty of the Mind
whereby we compare two Judgments, one with
the other, and from the comparison deduce a
third Judgment. This is a form of indirect or
mediate comparison, whereas the Judgment is
a form of immediate or direct comparison.
From this process of Reasoning arises a result
which is expressed in what is called a
Syllogism, as for instance: "All dogs are animals;
Carlo is a dog; therefore, Carlo is an
animal." Or expressed in symbols: "A equals
C; and B equals C;" therefore, "A equals B."
Reasoning is of two kinds or classes; <i>viz.</i>, In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ductive
and Deductive, respectively. We
have explained these forms of Reasoning in
detail in another volume of this series.</p>

<p><i>The Feelings</i> are the mental faculties
whereby we experience emotions or feelings.
Feelings are the experiencing of the agreeable
or disagreeable nature of our mental states.
They can be defined only in their own terms.
If we have never experienced a feeling, we
cannot understand the words expressing it.
Feelings result in what are called emotion, affection
and desire. An emotion is the simple
feeling, such as joy, sorrow, etc. An affection
is an emotion reaching out toward another and
outside object, such as envy, jealousy, love, etc.
A desire is an emotion arising from the <i>want</i>
of some lacking quality or thing, and the inclination
to possess it.</p>

<p><i>Memory</i> is the faculty of the Mind whereby
we retain and reproduce, or consciously revive
any kind of past mental experience. It has
two sub-phases; <i>viz.</i>, Retention and Recollection,
respectively. It manifests in the storing
away of mental images and ideas, and in the
reproduction of them at a later period of time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and also of the recognition of them as objects
of past experience.</p>

<p><i>Imagination</i> is the faculty of the Mind
whereby we represent (<i>re-pre-sent</i>) as a
mental image some previously experienced
idea, concept or image. Its activities are
closely allied and blended with those of the
Memory. It has the power not only of reproducing
objects already perceived but also another
power of <i>ideal creation</i> whereby it
<i>creates</i> new combinations from the materials
of past experience. It is a faculty, the importance
of which is but little understood by
the majority of men. Inasmuch as the mental
image must always precede the material manifestation,
the cultivation of the Imagination
becomes a matter of great importance and
worthy of the closest study.</p>

<p><i>Intuition</i> is the faculty of the Mind whereby
it evolves what have been called Primary
Truths or Primary Ideas. By Primary Ideas
are meant the ideas of Space, Time, Cause,
Identity, etc. By Primary Truths are meant
the so-called "Self-Evident Truths" of geometry,
mathematics and logic. Under the head
of Intuition are also sometimes included the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
activities of the Subconscious or Superconscious
regions of the mind, of which we have
spoken in detail in a volume under that name
of this series. Some authorities hold to the
older idea of "Innate Ideas" by which is
meant that every human being is born with the
knowledge of certain fundamental truths, unconnected
with any experience. Others hold
that these ideas are simply the result of the
experience of the race, transmitted to us as
"germ ideas" which must grow by experience
and exercise.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>That each and every faculty of the Mind
may be strengthened and developed by Culture
and Exercise is now held to be a fact by
nearly every authority worthy of that name.
Just as the physical muscle may be cultivated
by the proper methods, so may the mental
faculties be strengthened and cultivated by
the appropriate methods and means. Inasmuch
as the majority of the race are deficient
in the development of one or more of the leading
mental faculties, it becomes a matter of
great interest and importance that all should
acquaint themselves with the means whereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
their deficiencies may be corrected and remedied.
We shall now proceed to the consideration
of Thought-Culture in general, and
then to the consideration of the culture of each
particular general faculty, in detail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="chap">THOUGHT-CULTURE</p>


<p>Thought-Culture is based upon two general
scientific facts which may be stated as follows:</p>

<p>I. The brain centres of thought may be
developed by exercise. While we do not assert
that the brain and the mind are identical,
it is nevertheless a scientific truth that "the
brain is the organ of the mind" and that one
of the first requisites for a good mind is a good
brain. It has been proven by experiment that
the brain-cells concerned in special mental activities
multiply in proportion to the active use
of the special faculties employed in the mental
operation. It has also been ascertained that
disuse of special faculties of the mind tends to
cause a process akin to atrophy in the brain-cells
concerned in the particular activity, so
that it becomes difficult to think clearly along
those particular lines after a long period of
disuse. Moreover, it is known that the education
and mental culture of a child is accompanied
by an increase and development of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
brain-cells connected with the particular fields
of thought in which the child is exercised.</p>

<p>There is a close analogy between the exercise
of the brain-cells and the exercise of the
muscles of the body. Both respond to reasonable
exercise; both are injured by overwork;
both degenerate by disuse. As Brooks says:
"The mind grows by its own inherent energies.
Mental exercise is thus the law of mental
development. As a muscle grows strong
by use, so any faculty of the mind is developed
by its proper use and exercise. An inactive
mind, like an unused muscle, becomes weak
and unskilful. Hang the arm in a sling and
the muscle becomes flabby and loses its vigor
and skill; let the mind remain inactive and it
acquires a mental flabbiness that unfits it for
any severe or prolonged activity. An idle
mind loses its tone and strength like an unused
muscle; the mental powers go to rust
through idleness and inaction. To develop
the faculties of the mind and secure their highest
activity and efficiency, there must be a constant
and judicious exercise of these faculties.
The object of culture is to stimulate and direct
the activity of the mind."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Experiments conducted by scientists upon
dogs have shown that in the case of dogs specially
trained to unusual mental activity, there
has been a corresponding increase of the number
of active brain-cells in the particular parts
of the brain concerned with those mental activities.
Microscopic examination of the brain
tissues showed the greatest difference between
the brain structure of the trained dogs
and untrained ones of the same brood. So
carefully were the experiments conducted that
it was possible to distinguish between the
dogs trained in one set of activities from those
trained in another. Biologists have demonstrated
the correctness of the brain-cell development
theory beyond reasonable doubt,
and ordinary human experience also adds its
testimony in its favor.</p>

<p>In view of the above, it will be seen that by
intelligent exercise and use any and all faculties
of the mind may be developed and cultivated,
just as may any special muscle of the
body. And this exercise can come only from
actual use of the faculties themselves. Development
must come from within and not
from without. No system of outward stimula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>tion
will develop the faculties of the mind&mdash;they
may be cultivated only by an exercise in
their own particular field of work. The only
way to exercise any particular faculty of
thought is to <i>think</i> through that faculty.</p>

<p>II. Not only are the brain-cells developed
by exercise, but it also appears to be a fact
that the mind appears actually to be <i>nourished</i>
by knowledge of the outside world of things.
The raw material of thought is taken into the
mind and there is digested by the thought-processes,
and is afterward actually <i>assimilated</i>
by the mind in a manner strikingly similar
to the processes of the physical organs of
nutrition. A mind to be at its best must be
supplied with a normal amount of mental
nourishment. Lacking this, it tends to become
weak and inefficient. And, likewise, if its
owner is a mental glutton and furnishes too
much nourishment, particularly of a rich kind,
there is a tendency toward "mental dyspepsia"
and indigestion&mdash;the mind, unable to assimilate
the mental food furnished it, is inclined
to rebel. Moreover, if the mind be supplied
with mental food of only one kind&mdash;if the
mind is confined to one narrow field of thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>&mdash;it
weakens and the mental processes become
impaired. In many ways is this curious analogy
apparent.</p>

<p>Not only does the mind need development,
but it also needs intelligent cultivation. For
it may be <i>developed</i> by improper objects of
thought just as well as by the proper ones. A
rich field will grow tares and weeds as well as
good grain or fruit. Thought-culture should
not be confined to the <i>development of a strong
and active mind</i>, but should be also extended
to the <i>cultivation of a wise and intelligent
mind</i>. Strength and Wisdom should be combined.
Moreover there should be sought a
harmonious and normal development. A one-sided,
mental development is apt to produce
a "crank," while a development in unhealthy
mental fields will produce an abnormal thinker
tending dangerously near to the line of insanity.
Some "one-idea" men have great mental
power and development, but are nevertheless
unbalanced and impractical. And insane persons
often have strongly developed minds&mdash;developed
abnormally.</p>

<p>Some authorities, holding special theories
regarding the nature of mind, hold that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Thought-Culture is merely a <i>training</i> of the
faculties rather than a <i>creation</i> of new mental
power, inasmuch as the mind cannot be built
up from the outside. This is a curious combination
of truth and error. It is true that the
mind cannot be built up from outside material,
in the sense of creating <i>new mind</i>, but it is also
true that in every mind there is the potentiality
of growth and development. Just as the
future oak is said to be in the acorn, so are the
potentialities of mind-growth in every mind
waiting for nourishment from outside and the
proper cultivation. Brooks has well stated
this, as follows: "The culture of the mind is
not creative in its character; its object is to develop
existing possibilities into realities. The
mind possesses innate powers which may be
awakened into a natural activity. The design
of culture is to aid nature in improving the
powers she has given. No new power can be
created by culture; we can increase the activity
of these powers, but cannot develop any
new activities. Through these activities new
ideas and thoughts may be developed, and the
sum of human knowledge increased; but this
is accomplished by a high activity of the nat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>ural
powers with which the mind is endowed,
and not by the culture of new powers. The
profound philosopher uses the same faculties
that the little child is developing in the games
of the nursery. The object of culture is to
arouse the powers which nature has given us
into a normal activity and to stimulate and
guide them in their unfolding."</p>

<p>In connection with the objection above mentioned,
it may be said that while the development
of the mind must come from within itself,
rather than from without, nevertheless,
in order to develop, it must have the nourishing
material from the outside world in order
to grow. Just as the body can grow from
within only by the aid of nourishment from
outside, so the mind, while growing from
within, needs the material for thought which
can come only from without itself. Thought
requires "things" upon which to exercise itself&mdash;and
upon which it is nourished. Without
these outside objects, it can have no exercise
and can receive no nourishment. Thought
consists in the perception, examination and
comparison of <i>things</i>, and the consequent
building up new combinations, arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and syntheses. Therefore, the perceptive faculties
are most necessary to Thought, and
their culture is most necessary in the general
work of Thought-Culture.</p>

<p>It must not be lost sight of that in Thought-Culture
there is necessary a variety of exercises
and forms of nourishment. What will
develop one faculty will exert but a faint effect
upon others. Each needs its own particular
kind of exercise&mdash;each its particular kind
of mental nourishment. While it is true that
there is a certain benefit gained by the entire
mind from an exercise of any of its parts, this
effect is but secondary in importance. A man
well developed mentally has been developed in
each faculty, each in its own way. The faculty
of perception requires objects of perception;
the faculty of imagination requires objects of
imagination; the faculty of reasoning requires
objects of reasoning; and so on, each
requiring objects of exercise and nourishment
of its own kind&mdash;in its own class. In some
persons some of the faculties are well developed
while others are deficient. It follows
that in such a case the weak faculties should
be developed first, that they be brought up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the general standard. Then a further general
development may be undertaken if desired.
Moreover, in general development, it will be
found that certain faculties will respond more
readily to the cultivation given, while others
will be slow to respond. In such cases wisdom
dictates that a greater degree of exercise and
nourishment be given to the slower and less
responsible faculties, while the more responsive
be given but a lighter development. In
Thought-Culture as in physical culture, the
less developed and slower responding parts
should be given special attention.</p>

<p>In the following chapters we shall point out
the methods and exercises calculated to develop
the several faculties of the mind to the
best advantage, in each case giving general
advice along the lines of the cultivation of the
particular faculty which will serve as general
instruction regarding its culture. The student
should carefully study the entire work
before he attempts to specialize in the development
of any particular faculty. The particular
work may be aided by an acquaintance
with the entire field of Thought-Culture for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
many of the faculties shade into each other in
their activities and are always more or less
interdependent. For, be it remembered, the
mind is a <i>whole</i>, and not a mere aggregation
of many parts. To understand the parts, one
must study the whole&mdash;to understand the
whole, one must study the parts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">ATTENTION</p>


<p>Attention is not a faculty of the mind in the
same sense as perception, abstraction, judgment,
etc., but is rather in the nature of an act
of will concerned in the focusing of the consciousness
upon some object of thought presented
or represented to the mind. In some
respects it bears a resemblance to Abstraction,
inasmuch as it sets aside some particular
object for the consideration of the consciousness,
to the exclusion of other objects. Wayland
explains attention as a condition of mind
in which the consciousness is excited and directed
by an act of the will. Hamilton says:
"Consciousness may be compared to a telescope;
Attention is the pulling out and pressing
in of the tubes in accommodating the focus
of the eye;" and also that: "An act of attention,
that is an act of concentration, seems
thus necessary to every exertion of consciousness,
as a certain contraction of the pupil is
requisite to every exertion of vision....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Attention then is to consciousness what the
contraction of the pupil is to sight, or to the
eye of the mind what the microscope or telescope
is to the bodily eye.... It constitutes
the better half of all intellectual power."</p>

<p>Brodie says that: "It is Attention, much
more than any difference in the abstract power
of reasoning, which constitutes the vast difference
which exists between minds of different
individuals." Butler says: "The most
important intellectual habit that I know of is
the habit of attending exclusively to the matter
in hand.... It is commonly said that
genius cannot be infused by education, yet
this power of concentrated attention, which
belongs as a part of his gift to every great discoverer,
is unquestionably capable of almost
indefinite augmentation by resolute practice."
And Beattie says: "The force wherewith anything
strikes the mind is generally in proportion
to the degree of attention bestowed upon
it."</p>

<p>Realizing the importance of attention, the
student will naturally wish to cultivate the
power of bestowing it when necessary. The
first role in the cultivation of the attention is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
that the student shall carefully acquire <i>the
habit of thinking of or doing but one thing at
a time</i>. This first rule may seem easy, but in
practice it will be found very difficult of observance,
so careless are the majority of us in
our actions and thinking. Not only will the
trouble and care bestowed upon the acquiring
of this habit of thought and action be well repaid
by the development of the attention, but
the student will also acquire a facility for accomplishing
his tasks quickly and thoroughly.
As Kay says: "There is nothing that contributes
more to success in any pursuit than that
of having the attention concentrated on the
matter in hand; and, on the contrary, nothing
is more detrimental than when doing one thing
to have the mind taken up with something
else." And as Granville says: "A frequent
cause of failure in the faculty of attention is
striving to think of more than one thing at a
time." Kay also well says: "If we would
possess the power of attention in a high degree,
we must cultivate the habit of attending
to what is directly before the mind, to the exclusion
of all else. All distracting thoughts
and feelings that tend to withdraw the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
from what is immediately before it are therefore
to be carefully avoided. This is a matter
of great importance, and of no little difficulty.
Frequently the mind, in place of being concentrated
on what is immediately before it, is
thinking of something else&mdash;something, it may
be, that went before or that may come after,
or something quite alien to the subject."</p>

<p>The following principles of the application
of the attention have been stated by the authorities:</p>

<p>I. The attention attaches more readily to
interesting than to uninteresting things.</p>

<p>II. The attention will decline in strength
unless there is a variation in the stimulus,
either by a change of object or the developing
of some new attribute in the object.</p>

<p>III. The attention, when tired by continuous
direction toward some unvarying object,
may be revived by directing it toward some
new object or in allowing it to be attracted and
held by some passing object.</p>

<p>IV. The attention manifests in a two-fold
activity; <i>viz.</i> (1) the concentration upon some
one object of thought; and (2) the shutting out
of outside objects. Thus, it has its positive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
negative sides. Thus, when a man wishes to
give his undivided attention to one speaker in
a crowd of speaking individuals, he acts positively
in focusing his consciousness upon the
selected individual, and negatively by refusing
to listen to the others.</p>

<p>V. The attention is not a faculty, but a
means of using any faculty with an increased
degree of efficiency.</p>

<p>VI. The degree of attention possessed by
an individual is an indication of his power of
using his intellect. Many authorities have
held that, in cases of genius, the power of concentrated
attention is usually greatly developed.
Brooks says: "Attention is one of the
principal elements of genius." Hamilton
says: "Genius is a higher capacity of attention."
Helvetius says: "Genius is nothing
but protracted attention." Chesterfield says:
"The power of applying our attention, steady
and undissipated, to a single object is a sure
mark of superior genius."</p>

<p>The attention may be cultivated, just as
may be the various faculties of the mind, by
the two-fold method of Exercise and Nourish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>ment;
that is, by using and employing it actively
and by furnishing it with the proper
materials with which to feed its strength. The
way to exercise the attention is <i>to use it frequently</i>
in every-day life. If you are listening
to a man speaking, endeavor to give to him
your undivided attention, and, at the same
time, to shut out from your consciousness
every other object. In working, we should
endeavor to use the attention by concentrating
our interest upon the particular task before
us to the exclusion of all else. In reading, we
should endeavor to hold our minds closely to
the text instead of hastily glancing over the
page as so many do.</p>

<p>Those who wish to cultivate their attention
should take up some line of study in which it is
necessary to fasten the attention firmly for a
time. A half-hour's study in this way is worth
more than hours of careless reading so far as
the cultivation of the attention is concerned.
Mathematics is most valuable in the direction
of developing the power of attention. Gibbon
says: "After a rapid glance on the subject
and distribution of a new book, I suspend the
reading of it which I only resume after having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
myself examined the subject in all its
relations."</p>

<p>Some writers have held that the attention
may be developed by the practice of selecting
the voice of one person speaking among a
crowd of speakers, and deliberately shutting
out the other sounds, giving the whole attention
to the particular speaker; or, in the same
manner, selecting one singer in a church choir
or band of singers; or one musical instrument
in an orchestra; or one piece of machinery
making sounds in a room filled with various
machines, etc. The practice of so doing is
held to strengthen one's powers of concentration
and attention.</p>

<p>Draper says: "Although many images may
be simultaneously existing upon the retina,
the mind possesses the power of singling out
any one of them and fastening attention upon
it, just as among a number of musical instruments
simultaneously played, one, and that
perhaps the feeblest, may be selected and its
notes exclusively followed." And as Taylor
says: "In a concert of several voices, the
voices being of nearly equal intensity, regarded
merely as organic impressions on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
auditory nerve, we select one, and at will we
lift out and disjoin it from the general volume
of sound; we shut off the other voices&mdash;five,
ten and more&mdash;and follow this one alone.
When we have done so for a time, we freely
cast it off and take up another." Carpenter
says: "The more completely the mental energy
can be brought into one focus and all distracting
objects excluded, the more powerful
will be the volitional effort."</p>

<p>Many authorities hold that the attention
may be best applied and exercised by analyzing
an object mentally, and then considering
its parts one by one by a process of abstraction.
Thus, as Kays says: "An apple presents
to us form, color, taste, smell, etc., and if
we would obtain a clear idea of any one of
these, we must contemplate it by itself and
compare it with other impressions of the same
kind we have previously experienced. So in
viewing a landscape, it is not enough to regard
it merely as a whole, but we must regard
each of its different parts individually by itself
if we would obtain a clear idea of it. We
can only obtain a full and complete knowledge
of an object <i>by analyzing it and concentrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the attention upon its different parts, one by
one</i>." Reid says: "It is not by the senses immediately,
but rather by the power of <i>analyzing
and abstraction</i>, that we get the most simple
and the most distinct notions of objects of
sense." And, as Brown says: "It is scarcely
possible to advance even a single step in intellectual
physics without the necessity of performing
<i>some sort of analysis</i>." In all processes
requiring analysis and examination of
parts, properties or qualities, the attention is
actively employed. Accordingly, it follows
that such exercises are best adapted to the
work of developing and cultivating the attention
itself. Therefore, as a parting word we
may say: <i>To develop and cultivate the power
of attention and concentration, (1) Analyze;
(2) Analyze; and (3) Analyze. Analyze
everything and everybody with which or whom
you come in contact.</i> There is no better or
shorter rule.</p>

<p>The student will also find that the various
directions and the advice which we shall give
in the succeeding chapters, regarding the cultivation
of the various faculties, are also
adapted to the development of the attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
for the latter is brought into active play in
them. And, likewise, by developing the attention,
one may practice the future exercises
with greater effect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="chap">PERCEPTION</p>


<p>In preceding chapters we have seen that in
the phase of mental activity in which the Intellect
is concerned, the processes of which
are known as "Thought" in the narrower
sense of the term, there are several stages or
steps involving the use of several faculties of
the mind. The first of these steps or stages is
called <i>Perception</i>.</p>

<p>Many persons confuse the idea of Sensation
and Perception, but there is a clear distinction
between them. Sensations arise from nerve
action&mdash;from the stimulation of nerve substance&mdash;which
gives rise to a peculiar effect
upon the brain, which results in an elementary
form of consciousness. An authority says:
"Sensation is the peculiar property of the
nervous system in a state of activity, by which
impressions are conveyed to the brain or sensorium.
When an impression is made upon
any portion of the bodily surface by contact,
heat, electricity, light, or any other agent, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
mind is rendered conscious of this by sensation.
In the process there are three stages&mdash;reception
of the impression at the end of the
sensory nerve, the conduction of it along the
nerve trunk to the sensorium, and <i>the change
it excites in the sensorium itself, through
which is produced sensation</i>.</p>

<p>Just why and how this nerve action is translated
into consciousness of an elementary
kind, science is unable to explain. Our knowledge
is based in a great part, or entirely, upon
impressions which have been received over
the channel of the senses&mdash;sensations of sight,
hearing, tasting, smelling and touch. Many
authorities hold that all of the five senses are
modifications of the sense of touch, or feeling;
as for instance, the impression upon the organs
of sight is really in the nature of a delicate
touch or feeling of the light-waves as
they come in contact with the nerves of vision,
etc. But, although sensations give us the
raw materials of thought, so to speak, they are
not <i>knowledge</i> in themselves. Knowledge
arises from the operation of Perception upon
this raw material of Sensation.</p>

<p>But yet, Sensation plays a most active part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
in the presentation of the raw material for the
Perceptive faculties, and must not be regarded
as merely a physiological process. It
may be said to be the connecting link between
the physical and the mental activities. As
Ziehen says: "It follows that the constitution
of the nervous system is an essential factor
in determining the quality of sensation.
This fact reveals the obvious error of former
centuries, first refuted by Locke, though still
shared by naive thought today, that the objects
about us themselves are colored, warm,
cold, etc. As external to our consciousness,
we can only assume matter, vibrating with
molecular motion and permeated by vibrating
particles of ether. The nervous apparatus
selects only certain motions of matter or of
ether, which they transform into that form of
nerve excitation with which they are familiar.
It is only this nerve excitation that we
perceive as red, warm or hard."</p>

<p>Passing from Sensation to Perception, we
see that the latter interprets the reports of
the former. Perception translates into consciousness
the impressions of Sensation. Perception,
acting through one or more of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
mental faculties, gives us <i>our first bit of real
knowledge</i>. Sensation may give us the impression
of a small moving thing&mdash;Perception
translates this into the thought of <i>a cat</i>. Sensation
is a mere <i>feeling</i>&mdash;Perception is the
<i>thought</i> arising from that feeling. A Percept
is the product of Perception, or in other words,
our <i>idea</i> gained through Perception. The majority
of our percepts are complex, being built
up from a number of minor percepts; as for
instance, our percept of <i>a peach</i> is built up
from our minor percepts of the form, shape,
color, weight, degree of hardness, smell, taste,
etc., of the peach, each sense employed giving
minor percepts, the whole being combined in
the conscious as the whole percept of that particular
peach.</p>

<p>Brooks says: "All knowledge does not
come directly from perception through the
senses, however. We have a knowledge of external
objects, and we have a knowledge that
transcends this knowledge of external objects.
Perception is the <i>immediate</i> source of the first
kind of knowledge, and the <i>indirect</i> source of
the second kind of knowledge. This distinction
is often expressed by the terms <i>cause</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and <i>occasion</i>. Thus perception is said to be
the <i>cause</i> of our knowledge of objects, since it
is the immediate source of such knowledge.
Perception is also said to be the <i>occasion</i> of
the ideas and truths of intuition; for, though
in a sense necessary to these ideas, it is not the
source of them. Perception also furnishes
the understanding with materials out of which
it derives ideas and truths beyond the field of
sense. As thus attaining a knowledge of external
objects, affording material for the operations
of the understanding, and furnishing
the occasion for the activity of the intuitive
power, <i>perception may be said to lie at the
basis of all knowledge</i>."</p>

<p>Perception is of course manifest in all persons.
But it varies greatly in degree and
power. Moreover, it may be developed and
cultivated to a great degree. As Perception
is an interpretation of the impression of the
senses, we often confuse the cultivation of
Perception with the development of the senses
themselves. Two persons of equally perfect
sense of sight may vary greatly in their degree
of Perception of sight impressions. One may
be a most careless observer, while the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
may be a very close observer and able to distinguish
many points of interest and importance
in the object viewed which are not apparent
to the first observer. Cultivation of
Perception is cultivation of the <i>mental background
of the senses</i>, rather than of the sense
organs themselves. The Perception accompanying
each sense may be developed and cultivated
separately from that accompanying
the others.</p>

<p>The majority of persons are very careless
observers. They will <i>see</i> things without <i>perceiving</i>
the qualities, properties, characteristics,
or parts which together make up those
things. Two persons, possessed of equal degrees
of eyesight, will walk through a forest.
Both of them will <i>see</i> trees. To one of them
there will be but trees perceived; while to the
other there will be a perception of the different
species of trees, with their varying bark,
leaves, shape, etc. One perceives simply a
"pile of stone," which to the perception of
another will be recognized as granite, marble,
etc. Brooks says: "Very few persons can
tell the difference between the number of legs
of a fly and of a spider; and I have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
farmers' boys and girls who could not tell
whether the ears of a cow are in front of her
horns, above her horns, below her horns, or
behind her horns." Halleck says of a test in
a schoolroom: "Fifteen pupils were sure
that they had seen cats climb trees and descend
them. There was a unanimity of opinion
that the cats went up head first. When asked
whether the cats came down head or tail first,
the majority were sure that the cats descended
as they were never known to do. Anyone who
had ever noticed the shape of the claws of any
beast of prey could have answered that question
without seeing an actual descent. Farmers'
boys, who have often seen cows and horses
lie down and rise, are seldom sure whether the
animals rise with their fore or hind feet first,
or whether the habit of the horse agrees with
that of the cow in this respect."</p>

<p>Brooks well says: "Modern education
tends to the neglect of the culture of the perceptive
powers. In ancient times people
studied nature much more than at present.
Being without books, they were compelled to
depend upon their eyes and ears for knowledge;
and this made their senses active,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
searching and exact. At the present day, we
study books for a knowledge of external
things; and we study them too much or too exclusively,
and thus neglect the cultivation of
the senses. We get our knowledge of the material
world second-hand, instead of fresh
from the open pages of the book of nature. Is
it not a great mistake to spend so much time in
school and yet not know the difference between
the leaf of a beech and of an oak; or
not be able to distinguish between specimens
of marble, quartz, and granite? The neglect
of the culture of the perceptive powers is
shown by the scholars of the present time.
Very few educated men are good observers;
indeed, the most of them are sadly deficient
in this respect.... They were taught to
think and remember; but were not taught to
use their eyes and ears. In modern education,
books are used too much like spectacles, and
the result is the blunting of the natural powers
of perception."</p>

<p>The first principle in the Cultivation of Perception
is the correct use of the Attention.
The intelligent control of voluntary attention
is a prerequisite to clear and distinct percep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>tion.
We have called your attention to this
matter in the preceding chapter. Halleck
says: "A body may be imaged on the retina
without insuring perception. There must be
an effort to concentrate the attention upon the
many things which the world presents to our
senses.... Perception, to achieve satisfactory
results, must summon the will to its
aid to concentrate the attention. Only the
smallest part of what falls upon our senses
at any time is actually perceived."</p>

<p>The sense of sight is perhaps the one of the
greatest importance to us, and accordingly the
cultivation of Perception with regard to impressions
received through the eye is the most
important for the ordinary individual. As
Kay says: "To see clearly is a valuable aid
even to thinking clearly. In all our mental
operations we owe much to sight. To recollect,
to think, to imagine, is to see internally,&mdash;to
call up more or less visual images of things
before the mind. In order to understand a
thing it is generally necessary to see it, and
what a man has not seen he cannot properly
realize or image distinctly to his mind....
It is by the habitual direction of our attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to the effects produced upon our consciousness
by the impressions made upon the eye
and transmitted to the sensorium that our
sight, like our other senses, is trained." Bain
says: "Cohering trains and aggregates of
the sensations of sight make more than any
other thing, perhaps more than all other things
put together, the material of thought, memory
and imagination." Vinet says: "The child,
and perhaps the man as well, only knows well
what is shown him, and the image of things
is the true medium between their abstract idea
and his personal experience." This being
the case, advice concerning the Cultivation of
Perception must needs be directed mainly to
the cultivation of the perception of sight-impressions.</p>

<p>Brooks says: "We should acquire the
habit of observing with attention. Many persons
look at objects with a careless, inattentive
eye. We should guard against the habit of
careless looking. We should fix the mind
upon the object before us; we should concentrate
the attention upon that upon which we
are looking. Attention, in respect to Perception,
has been compared to a burning glass;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
hold the sun-glass between the sun and a
board and the concentrated rays will burn a
hole through the latter. So attention concentrates
the rays of perceptive power and enables
the mind to penetrate below the surface
of things."</p>

<p>The best authorities agree in the idea that
the Perception may be best cultivated by acquiring
the habit of examining things in detail.
And, that this examination in detail is best
manifested by examining the parts going to
make up a complex thing, separately, rather
than examining the thing as a whole. Halleck
says regarding this point: "To look at things
intelligently is the most difficult of all arts.
The first rule for the cultivation of accurate
perception is: Do not try to perceive the
whole of a complex object at once. Take the
human face for example. A man holding an
important position to which he had been
elected offended many people because he could
not remember faces, and hence failed to recognize
individuals the second time he met them.
His trouble was in looking at the countenance
as a whole. When he changed his method of
observation, and noticed carefully the nose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
mouth, eyes, chin and color of hair, he at once
began to find recognition easier. He was no
longer in danger of mistaking A for B, since
he remembered that the shape of B's nose was
different, or the color of his hair at least three
shades lighter. This example shows that another
rule can be formulated: Pay careful
attention to details.... To see an object
merely as an undiscriminated mass of something
in a certain place is to do no more than
a donkey accomplishes as he trots along."</p>

<p>Brooks says regarding the same point: "To
train the powers of observation we should
practice observing minutely. We should analyze
the objects which we look at into their
parts, and notice these parts. Objects present
themselves to us as wholes; our definite knowledge
of them is gained by analysis, by separating
them into the elements which compose
them. We should therefore give attention to
the details of whatever we are considering;
and thus cultivate the habit of observing with
minuteness.... It is related of a teacher
that if, when hearing a class, some one rapped
at the door, he would look up as the visitor
entered and from a single glance could tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
his appearance and dress, the kind of hat he
wore, kind of necktie, collar, vest, coat, shoes,
etc. The skillful banker, also, in counting
money with wondrous rapidity, will detect and
throw from his pile of bills the counterfeits
which, to the ordinary eye, seem to be without
spot or blemish."</p>

<p>One of the best methods of developing and
cultivating the faculty of Perception is to take
up some study in which the perceptive faculties
<i>must be</i> employed. Botany, physics, geology,
natural history give splendid exercise
in Perception, providing the student engages
in actual experimental work, and actual observation,
instead of confining himself to the textbooks.
A careful scientific study and examination
of <i>any kind of objects</i>, in a manner calculated
to bring out the various points of resemblance
and difference, will do most to develop
the Perception. Training of this kind
will develop these powers to a high degree, in
the case of small children.</p>

<p>Drawing is also a great help to the development
of Perception. In order to draw a thing
correctly we must of necessity examine it in
detail; otherwise we will not be able to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
it correctly. In fact, many authorities use the
test of drawing to prove the degree of attention
and Perception that the student has bestowed
upon an object which he has been
studying. Others place an object before the
pupil for a few minutes, and then withdraw
it, the pupil then being required to draw the
object roughly but with attention to its leading
peculiarities and features. Then the object
is again placed before the pupil for study,
and he is then again required to draw from
memory the additional details he has noticed
in it. This process is repeated over and over
again, until the pupil has proved that he has
<i>observed</i> every possible detail of interest in
the object. This exercise has resulted in the
cultivation of a high degree of perception in
many students, and its simplicity should not
detract from its importance. Any person may
practice this exercise by himself; or, better
still, two or more students may combine and
endeavor to excel each other in friendly rivalry,
each endeavoring to discover the greatest
number of details in the object considered.
So rapidly do students improve under this
exercise, that a daily record will show a steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
advance. Simple exercises in drawing are
found in the reproduction, from memory, of
geography maps, leaves of trees, etc.</p>

<p>Similar exercises may be found in the practice
of taking a hasty look at a person, animal
or building, and then endeavoring to reproduce
in writing the particular points about the
person or thing observed. This exercise will
reveal rapid progress if persisted in. Or, it
may be varied by endeavoring to write out
the contents of a room through which one has
walked.</p>

<p>The majority of our readers remember the
familiar story of Houdin, who so cultivated
the faculty of Perception that he was able to
pass by a shop-window and afterward state
in detail every object in the window. He acquired
this power by gradual development,
beginning with the observation of a single
article in the window, then two, then three
and so on. Others have followed his method
with great success. Speaking of Houdin's
wonderful Perception, Halleck says: "A
wide-awake eagle would probably see more
of a thing at one glance than would a drowsy
lizard in a quarter of an hour. Extreme rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>ity
of Perception, due to careful training, was
one of the factors enabling Houdin and his son
to astonish everybody and to amass a fortune.
He placed a domino before the boy, and instead
of allowing him to count the spots, required
him to give the sum total at once. This
exercise was continued until each could give
instantaneously the sum of the spots on a
dozen dominoes. The sum was given just as
accurately as if five minutes had been consumed
in adding." Houdin, in his Memoirs
relating the above facts regarding his own
methods, states with due modesty, that many
women far excel him in this respect. He says:
"I can safely assert that a lady seeing another
pass at full speed in a carriage will have
had time to analyze her toilette from her bonnet
to her shoes, and be able to describe not
only the fashion and quality of the stuffs, but
also say if the lace be real or only machine
made."</p>

<p>There are a number of games played by
children which tend to the cultivation of the
Perception, and which might well be adapted
for the use of older people. These games are
based on the general principle of the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
participants taking a brief view of a number
of objects displayed in one's hand, on a table,
in a box, etc., and then stating what he or she
has seen. There will be noticed a wonderful
difference in the degree of Perception manifested
by the various participants. And,
equally interesting will be the degrees of progress
noted after playing this game over several
times, allowing time for rest between the
series of games. It is a fact well known in
police circles that thieves often train boys in
this way, following this course by another in
which the lads are expected to take in the contents
of a room, the windows, locks, etc., at a
glance. They are then graduated into spies
looking out the details of the scenes of future
robberies.</p>

<p>In our volume of this series, devoted to the
consideration of the Memory, we have related
a number of exercises and methods, similar to
those given above, by which the Perception
may be cultivated. Perception plays a most
important place in memory, for upon the clearness
of the percepts depends to a great degree
the clearness of the impressions made upon
the memory. So close is the connection be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>tween
Memory and Perception that the cultivation
of one tends to develop the other. For
instance, the cultivation of the Memory necessitates
the sharpening of the Perception in the
direction of obtaining clear original impressions;
while the cultivation of Perception naturally
develops the Memory by reason of the
fact that the latter is used in testing and proving
the clearness and degree of Perception.
This being the case, those who find that the exercises
and methods given above are too arduous
may substitute the simple exercise of
remembering as many details as possible of
things they see. This effort to impress the
memory will involuntarily bring into action
the perceptive faculties in the acquirement of
the original impressions, so that in the end
the Perception will be found to have developed.</p>

<p>Teachers and those having to do with children
should realize the great value of the cultivation
of Perception in the young, and thus
establishing valuable habits of observation
among them. The experience and culture thus
acquired will prove of great value in their
after life. As Brooks well says on this sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>ject:
"Teachers should appreciate the value
of the culture of the perceptive powers, and
endeavor to do something to afford this culture.
Let it be remembered that by training
the powers of observation of pupils, we lead
them to acquire definite ideas of things, enable
them to store their minds with fresh and
interesting knowledge, lay the foundation for
literary or business success, and thus do much
to enhance their happiness in life and add to
the sum of human knowledge."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">REPRESENTATION</p>


<p>Sensation and Perception, as considered in
the preceding chapter, are what are called by
psychologists "Processes of Presentation."
By Presentation is meant the direct offering
to the consciousness of mental images or objects
of thought. If there were no faculty of
the mind capable of retaining and <i>re</i>-presenting
to the consciousness the impression or
record of Perception, we could never progress
in knowledge, for each percept would be new
each time it was presented and there would
be no recognition of it as having been previously
perceived, nor would there be any power
to voluntarily recall any percept previously
acquired. In short, we would be without that
power of the mind called Memory.</p>

<p>But, fortunately for us as thinkers, we possess
the power of Representation; that is, of
reproducing past perceptions and experiences
in the shape of <i>mental images</i> or pictures, "in
the mind's eye," so to speak, which relieves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
us of the necessity of directly and immediately
perceiving an object each time we desire
or are required to think of it. The processes
whereby this becomes possible are called the
processes of Representation, for the reason
that by them past experiences of Perception
are <i>re</i>-presented to the consciousness.</p>

<p>The subject of Representation is closely
bound up with that of Memory. Strictly
speaking, Representation may be said to be
one phase of Memory; Association of Ideas
another; and the authorities prefer to treat
the whole subject under the general head of
Memory. We have written a work on "Memory"
which forms one of the volumes of the
present series, and we have no intention, or
desire, to repeat here the information given in
that work. But we must consider the subject
of Representation at this point in order to
maintain the logical unity of the present general
subject of Thought-Culture. The student
will also notice, of course, the close relation
between the processes of Representation and
those of the Imagination, which we shall consider
in other chapters of this work.</p>

<p>Memory has several phases, the usual classi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>fication
of which is as follows: (1) Impression;
(2) Retention; (3) Recollection; (4)
Representation, and (5) Recognition. Each
phase requires the operation of special mental
processes. <i>Impression</i> is the process whereby
the impressions of Perception are recorded or
stamped upon the subconscious field of mentality,
as the impress of the die upon the wax.
<i>Retention</i> is the process whereby the subconsciousness
<i>retains</i> or holds the impressions
so received. <i>Recollection</i> is the process by
which the mind <i>re-collects</i> the impressions retained
in the subconsciousness, bringing them
again into consciousness as objects of knowledge.
<i>Representation</i> is the process whereby
the impressions so re-collected are <i>pictured
or imaged</i> in the mind. <i>Recognition</i> is the
process whereby the mind <i>recognizes</i> the mental
image or picture so re-presented to it as
connected with its past experience.</p>

<p>As we have stated, we have considered the
general subject of Memory in another volume
of this series and, therefore, shall not attempt
to enter into a discussion of its general subject
at this place. We shall, accordingly, limit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
ourselves here to a brief consideration of the
phase of Representation and its cultivation.</p>

<p>Representation, of course, depends upon
the preceding phases of Memory known as
Impression, Retention and Recollection. Unless
the Impression is clear; unless the Retention
is normal, there can be no Representation.
And unless one <i>recollects</i> there can be no Representation.
Recollection (which is really a
re-collection of percepts) must precede Representation
in the shape of mental images or
pictures. Recollection re-collects the mental
materials out of which the image is to be constructed.
But, as Brooks says: "It is not to
be assumed that knowledge is retained as a
picture; but that it is <i>recreated</i> in the form of
a picture or some other mental product when
it is recalled." The process is analogous to
the transmutation of the sound-waves entering
the receiver of a telephone, into electrical-waves
which are transmitted to the receiver,
where they are in turn re-transmuted to
sound-waves which enter the ear of the
listener. It will be seen at once that there is
the closest possible relation between the processes
of Representation and those of Memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>&mdash;in
fact, it is quite difficult to draw a clear
line of division between them. Some make the
distinction that Representation furnishes us
with an exact reproduction of <i>the past</i>; while
Imagination combines our mental images into
<i>new products</i>. That is, Representation merely
<i>reproduces</i>; while Imagination <i>creates</i> by
forming new combinations; or Representation
deals with a reproduction of the Actual; while
Imagination deals with the Ideal.</p>

<p>Wundt speaking of this difficult distinction
says: "Psychologists are accustomed
to define <i>memory images</i> as ideas which <i>exactly
reproduce</i> some previous perception,
and <i>fancy images</i> as ideas consisting of a combination
of elements taken from a whole number
of perceptions. Now memory images in
the sense of this definition simply do not exist....
Try, for instance, to draw from memory
some landscape picture which you have
only once seen, and then compare your copy
with the original. You will expect to find
plenty of mistakes and omissions; but you
will also invariably find that you have put in
a great deal which was not in the original, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
which comes from landscape pictures which
you have seen somewhere else."</p>

<p>While we generally speak of Representation
<i>picturing</i> the recollected percepts, still,
we must not make the mistake of supposing
that it is concerned with, or limited to, only
mental pictures. We are able to <i>represent</i>
not only visual percepts but also sounds,
smells, tastes or feelings, often so vividly that
they appear as almost actually existent. We
may also even <i>represent</i>, symbolically the
processes of reasoning, mathematical operations,
etc. In short nearly, if not all experiences
which are possible in Presentation are
also possible in Representation.</p>

<p>The phase of Representation, in the processes
of Memory, is of course subject to the
general laws of the Cultivation of Memory
which we have stated in detail in our previous
volume on that subject. But there are some
special points of development and cultivation
which may be considered briefly in this place.
In the first place the importance of Attention
and clear Perception, as necessary precedents
for clear Representation, may be emphasized.
In order to form clear mental images of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
thing we must have perceived it clearly in the
first place. The advice regarding the use of
the Attention and Perception given in preceding
chapters need not be repeated here, but
special attention should be directed toward
them in connection with the processes of Representation.
If we wish to cultivate the Representative
faculties, we must begin by cultivating
the Presentative faculties.</p>

<p>Then again we must remember what we
have said elsewhere about the facts of development
through (1) Use; and (2) Nourishment,
in all mental faculties. We must begin
to <i>use</i> the faculties of Representation in order
to exercise them. We must give them <i>nourishment</i>
in the shape of objects of mental food.
That is to say we must furnish these faculties
with <i>materials</i> with which they may grow and
develop, and with exercise in order to
strengthen the mental-muscle and also to give
the faculties the opportunity to "acquire the
knack." The exercises and methods recommended
in our chapter on Perception will furnish
good <i>material</i> for the Representative
faculties' growing requirements. By <i>perceiving</i>
the details of things, one is able to repro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>duce
clear mental images of them. In studying
an object, always carry in your mind the fact
that you wish to <i>reproduce</i> it in your mind
later. In fact, if you have the opportunity,
let your mind "repeat it to itself" as soon as
possible after the actual occurrence and experience.
Just as you often murmur to yourself,
or else write down, the name of a person
or place which you have just heard, in order
that you may recollect it the better thereafter,
so it will be well for you to "mentally repeat"
to yourself the experiences upon which you
wish to exercise your Representative faculties.</p>

<p>As to the matter of development and cultivation
by Use, we would advise that you begin
gradually to train your mind to <i>reproduce</i> the
experiences of the day or week or month, at
intervals, until you feel that you are developing
a new power in that direction. Tonight,
if you try you will find that you can reproduce
but a very small part of today's happenings
with any degree of clearness. How clearly
can you image the places you have been, the
appearances of the people you have met, the
various details of persons and things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
you perceived during the experiences of the
day? Not very clearly, we dare say. Try
again, and you will find that you will be able
to add new details. Keep it up until you feel
tired or think that you have exhausted all the
possibilities of the task. Tomorrow, try it
again, and you will find that the second day's
experiences are more clearly reproduced in
your mind. Each day should find you a little
more advanced, until you get to a place where
the normal degree of power is attained, when
the advance will be slower.</p>

<p>Then, at the end of the week, review its experiences.
Do the same the following week.
At the end of the month, take a hasty mental
trip over the month's experiences. And so
on. Exercise, in moderation, along these lines
will work wonders for you. Not only will it
develop the Representation, but your powers
of observation and your general memory will
be found to be improved. And, moreover, in
"chewing the mental cud" you will think of
many things of interest and importance in connection
with your work, etc., and your general
mental efficiency will be increased for the faculties
of the mind are interdependent and
share benefits with each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="chap">ABSTRACTION</p>


<p>As we have seen, the first stage or step in
the process of Thought is that called Perception,
which we have considered in the preceding
chapter. Perception, as we have seen, is
the process by which we gain our first knowledge
of the external world as reported to us by
the channels of sense. The Perceptive faculties
interpret the material which is presented
to us by the senses. Following upon Perception
we find the processes resulting from the
exercise of the group of faculties which are
classified under the general head of Understanding.</p>

<p>Understanding is the faculty, or faculties,
of the mind by means of which we intelligently
examine and compare the various <i>percepts</i>,
either separating them by analysis, or else
combining them by synthesis, or both, and
thus securing our general ideas, principles,
laws, classes, etc. There are several sub-phases
of Understanding which are known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
psychologists and logicians as: (1) Abstraction;
(2) Conception or Generalization; (3)
Judgment, and (4) Reasoning, respectively.
In this chapter we shall consider the first of
these sub-phases or steps of Understanding,
which is known as "Abstraction."</p>

<p>Abstraction is that faculty of the mind by
which we abstract or "draw off," and then
consider apart, the particular qualities, properties,
or attributes of an object, and thus are
able to consider <i>them</i> as "things" or objects
of thought. In order to form <i>concepts</i> or general
ideas, from our <i>percepts</i> or particular
ideas, we must consider and examine two common
points or qualities which go to make up
<i>differences and resemblances</i>. The special
examination or consideration of these common
points or qualities result in the exercise
of Abstraction. In the process of Abstraction
we mentally "draw away" a quality of an
object and then consider it as a distinct object
of thought. Thus in considering a flower we
may <i>abstract</i> its qualities of fragrance, color,
shape, etc., and think of these as things independent
of the flower itself from which they
were derived. We think of <i>redness</i>, <i>fragrance</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
etc., not only in connection with the particular
flower but as <i>general qualities</i>. Thus the qualities
of redness, sweetness, hardness, softness,
etc., lead us to the abstract terms, <i>red</i>, <i>sweet</i>,
<i>hard</i>, <i>soft</i>, <i>etc.</i> In the same way courage,
cowardice, virtue, vice, love, hate, etc., are
abstract terms. No one ever saw one of these
things&mdash;they are known only in connection
with objects, or else as "abstract terms" in
the processes of Thought. They may be
known as qualities, and expressed as predicates;
or they may be considered as abstract
things and expressed as nouns.</p>

<p>In the general process of Abstraction we
first draw off and set aside all the qualities
which are <i>not common</i> to the general class
under consideration, for the concept or general
idea must comprise only the qualities
common to its class. Thus in the case of the
general idea of horse, size and color must be
abstracted as non-essentials, for horses are of
various colors and sizes. But on the other
hand, there are certain qualities which <i>are
common to all horses</i>, and these must be abstracted
and used in making up the concept or
general idea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>So, you see, in general Abstraction we form
two classes: (1) the unlike and not-general
qualities; and (2) the like or common qualities.
As Halleck says: "In the process of
Abstraction, we draw our attention away from
a mass of confusing details, unimportant at
the time, and attend only to qualities common
to the class. Abstraction is little else than
centering the power of attention on some qualities
to the exclusion of others.... While
we are forming concepts, we abstract or draw
off certain qualities, either to leave them out
of view or to consider them by themselves.
Our dictionaries contain such words as purity,
whiteness, sweetness, industry, courage,
etc. No one ever touched, tasted, smelled,
heard, or saw purity or courage. We do not,
therefore, gain our knowledge of these
through the senses. We have seen pure persons,
pure snow, pure honey; we have
breathed pure air, tasted pure coffee. From
all these different objects we have abstracted
the only like quality, the quality of being pure.
We then say we have an idea of <i>purity</i>, and
that idea is an abstract one. It exists only in
the mind which formed it. No one ever saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
<i>whiteness</i>. He may have seen white clouds,
snow, cloth, blossoms, houses, paper, horses,
but he never saw <i>whiteness</i> by itself. He simply
abstracted that quality from various white
objects."</p>

<p>In Abstraction we may either (1) abstract
a quality and set it aside and apart from the
other qualities under consideration, as being
non-essential and not necessary; or we may
(2) abstract a quality and hold it in the mind
as essential and necessary for the concept
which we are forming. Likewise, we may abstract
(1) all the qualities of an object <i>except
one</i>, and set them aside that we may consider
the <i>one</i> quality by itself; or we may (2) abstract
the one particular quality and consider
it to the exclusion of all its associated qualities.
In all of these aspects we have the same
underlying process of considering a quality
apart from its object, and apart from its associated
qualities. The mind more commonly
operates in the direction of abstracting one
quality and viewing it apart from object and
associated qualities.</p>

<p>The importance of correct powers of Abstraction
is seen when we realize that all con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>cepts
or general ideas are but combinations of
abstract qualities or ideas. As Halleck says:
"The difference between an <i>abstract idea</i> and
a <i>concept</i> is that a concept may consist of a
bundle of abstract ideas. If the class contains
more than one common quality, so must the
concept; it must contain as many of these abstracted
qualities as are common to the class.
The concept of the class <i>whale</i> would embody
a large number of such qualities." As Brooks
says: "If we could not abstract, we could not
<i>generalize</i>, for abstraction is a condition of
generalization." The last-mentioned authority
also cleverly states the idea as follows:
"The products of Abstraction are <i>abstract
ideas</i>, that is, ideas of qualities in the abstract.
Such ideas are called <i>Abstracts</i>. Thus my idea
of some particular color, or hardness, or softness,
is an abstract. Abstract ideas have been
wittily called 'the ghosts of departed qualities.'
They may more appropriately be regarded
as the spirits of which the objects from
which they are derived are the bodies. In
other words, they are, figuratively speaking,
'the disembodied spirits of material things.'"</p>

<p>The cultivation of the faculty of Abstrac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>tion
depends very materially, in the first place,
upon the exercise of Attention and Perception.
Mill holds that Abstraction is primarily
a result of Attention. Others hold that it is
merely the mental process by which the attention
is directed exclusively to the consideration
of one of several qualities, properties,
attributes, parts, etc. Hamilton says: "Attention
and Abstraction then are only the
same process viewed in different relations.
They are, as it were, the positive and negative
poles of the same act." The cultivation of Attention
is really a part of the process of the
cultivation of the faculty of Abstraction. Unless
the Attention be directed toward the object
and its qualities we will be unable to perceive,
set aside, and separately consider the
abstract quality contained within it. In this
process, as indeed in all other mental processes,
Attention is a prerequisite. Therefore,
here, as in many other places, we say to
you: "Begin by cultivating Attention."</p>

<p>Moreover, the cultivation of the faculty of
Abstraction depends materially upon the cultivation
of Perception. Not only must we
<i>sense</i> the existence of the various qualities in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
an object, but we must also <i>perceive</i> them in
consciousness, just as we perceive the object
itself. In fact, the perception of the object is
merely a perception of its various qualities,
attributes and properties, for the object itself
is merely a composite of these abstract things,
at least so far as its perception in consciousness
is concerned. Try to think of <i>a horse</i>,
without considering its qualities, attributes
and properties, and the result is merely <i>an
abstract horse</i>&mdash;something which belongs to
the realm of unreality. Try to think of <i>a rose</i>
without considering its color, odor, shape, size,
response to touch, etc., and you have simply
<i>an ideal rose</i> which when analyzed is seen to
be a <i>nothing</i>. Take away the qualities, properties
and attributes of anything, and you
have left <i>merely a name</i>, or else a transcendental,
idealistic, something apart from our
world of sense knowledge. Thus it follows
that in order to <i>know</i> the qualities of a thing
in order to classify it, or to form a general idea
of it, we <i>must</i> use the Perception in order to
interpret or translate the sense-impressions
we have received regarding them. Consequently
the greater our power of Perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the greater must be the possibility of our
power of Abstraction.</p>

<p>Beyond the cultivation, use and exercise of
the Attention and the Perception, there are
but few practical methods for cultivating the
faculty of Abstraction. Of course, <i>exercise</i>
of the faculty will develop it; and <i>the furnishing
of material for its activities</i> will give it
the "nourishment" of which we have spoken
elsewhere. Practice in distinguishing the
various qualities, attributes and properties
of objects will give a valuable training to the
faculty.</p>

<p>Let the student take any object and endeavor
to analyze it into its abstract qualities,
etc. Let him try to discover qualities hidden
from first sight. Let him make a list of these
qualities, and write them down; then try to
add to the list. Two or more students engaging
in a friendly rivalry will stimulate the efforts
of each other. In children the exercise
may be treated as a game. <i>Analysis of objects
into their component qualities, attributes and
qualities&mdash;the effort to extract as many adjectives
applicable to the object</i>&mdash;this is the
first step. The second step consists in <i>trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>forming
these adjectives into their corresponding
nouns</i>. As for instance, in a rose
we perceive the <i>qualities</i> which we call "redness,"
"fragrance," etc. We speak of the
rose as being "red" or "fragrant"&mdash;then we
think of "redness," or "fragrance" as abstract
qualities, or things, which we express
as nouns. Exercise and practice along these
lines will tend to cultivate the faculty of Abstraction.
By knowing qualities, we know the
things possessing them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS</p>


<p>Having formed general ideas, or Concepts,
it is important that we associate them with
other general ideas. In order to fully <i>understand</i>
a general idea we must know its associations
and relations. The greater the known
associations or relations of an idea, the
greater is our degree of understanding of that
idea. If we simply know many thousands of
separated general ideas, without also knowing
their associations and relations, we are in
almost as difficult a position as if we merely
knew thousands of individual percepts without
being able to classify them in general concepts.
It is necessary to develop the faculty
of associating ideas into groups, according to
their relations, just as we group particular
ideas in classes. The difference, however, is
that these group-ideas do not form classes of
a genus, but depend solely upon associations
of several kinds, as we shall see in a moment.</p>

<p>Halleck says: "All ideas have certain defin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>ite
associations with other ideas, and they
come up in groups. There is always an association
between our ideas, although there are
cases when we cannot trace it.... Even
when we find no association between our ideas,
we may be sure that it exists.... An idea,
then, never appears in consciousness unless
there is a definite reason why this idea should
appear in preference to others." Brooks
says: "One idea or feeling in the mind calls up
some other idea or feeling with which it is in
some way related. Our ideas seem, as it were,
to be tied together by the invisible thread of
association, so that as one comes out of unconsciousness,
it draws another with it.
Thoughts seem to exist somewhat in clusters
like the grapes of a bunch, so that in bringing
out one, we bring the entire cluster with it.
The law of association is thus the tie, the
thread, the golden link by which our thoughts
are united in an act of reproduction."</p>

<p>The majority of writers confine their consideration
of Association of Ideas to its relation
to Memory. It is true that the Laws of
Association play an important part in Memory
Culture, but Association of Ideas also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
form an important part of the general subject
of Thought-Culture, and especially in the
phase of the latter devoted to the development
of the Understanding. The best authorities
agree upon this idea and state it positively.
Ribot says: "The most fundamental
law which regulates psychological phenomena
is the Law of Association. In its comprehensive
character it is comparable to the law of
attraction in the physical world." Mill says:
"That which the law of gravitation is to astronomy,
that which the elementary properties
of the tissues are to physiology, the Law
of Association of Ideas is to psychology."</p>

<p>There are two general principles, or laws,
operative in the processes of Association of
Ideas, known as (1) Association by Contiguity;
and (2) Association by Similarity, respectively.</p>

<p>Association by Contiguity manifests particularly
in the processes of memory. In its
two phases of (1) Contiguity of Time; and
(2) Contiguity of Space, respectively, it
brings together before the field of consciousness
ideas associated with each by reason of
their time or space relations. Thus, if we re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>member
a certain thing, we find it easy to remember
things which occurred immediately
before, or immediately after that particular
thing. Verbal memory depends largely upon
the contiguity of time, as for instance, our
ability to repeat a poem, or passage from a
book, if we can recall the first words thereof.
Children often possess this form of memory
to a surprising degree; and adults with only
a limited degree of understanding may repeat
freely long extracts from speeches they have
heard, or even arbitrary jumbles of words.
Visual memory depends largely upon contiguity
of space, as for instance our ability to
recall the details of scenes, when starting
from a given point. In both of these forms of
association by contiguity the mental operation
is akin to that of unwinding a ball of yarn,
the ideas, thus associated in the sequence of
time or place, following each other into the
field of consciousness. Association by Contiguity,
while important in itself, properly belongs
to the general subject of Memory, and
as we have considered it in the volume of this
series devoted to the last mentioned subject,
we shall not speak of it further here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Association by Similarity, however, possesses
a special interest to students of the particular
subject of the culture of the Understanding.
If we were compelled to rely upon the
association of contiguity for our understanding
of things, we would understand a thing
merely in its relations to that which went before
or came after it; or by the things which
were near it in space&mdash;we would have to unwind
the mental ball of time and space relations
in order to bring into consciousness the
associated relations of anything. The Association
of Similarity, however, remedies this
defect, and gives us a higher and broader association.
Speaking of Association of Similarity,
Kay says: "It is of the utmost importance
to us in forming a judgment of things,
or in determining upon a particular line of
conduct, to be able to bring together before
the mind a number of instances of a <i>similar</i>
kind, recent or long past, which may aid us in
coming to a right determination. Thus, we
may judge of the nature or quality of an article,
and obtain light and leading in regard to
any subject that may be before us. In this
way we arrange and classify and reason by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
induction. <i>This is known as rational or philosophical
association.</i>"</p>

<p>Halleck says: "An eminent philosopher
has said that man is completely at the mercy
of the association of his ideas. Every new object
is seen in the light of its associated ideas....
It is not the business of the psychologist
to state what power the association of
ideas <i>ought</i> to have. It is for him to ascertain
what power it <i>does</i> have. When we think of
the bigotry of past ages, of the stake for the
martyr and the stoning of witches, we can
realize the force of Prof. Ziehen's statement:
'We cannot think as we <i>will</i>, but we <i>must</i> think
as just those associations which happen to be
present prescribe.' While this is not literally
true, it may serve to emphasize a deflecting
factor which is usually underestimated."</p>

<p>Locke says: "The connection in our minds
of ideas, in themselves loose and independent
of one another, has such an influence, and is
of so great force, to set us awry in our actions,
as well moral as natural, passions, reasonings,
and notions themselves, that, perhaps,
there is not any one thing that deserves more
to be looked after." Stewart says: "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
bulk of mankind, being but little accustomed
to reflect and to generalize, associate their
ideas chiefly according to their more obvious
relations, and above all to the casual relations
arising from contiguity in time and place;
whereas, in the mind of a philosopher ideas
are commonly associated according to those
relations which are brought to light in consequence
of particular efforts of attention, such
as the relations of cause and effect, or of
premises and conclusion. Hence, it must necessarily
happen that when he has occasion to
apply to use his acquired knowledge, time and
reflection will be requisite to enable him to
recollect it."</p>

<p>This Association by Similarity, or the
"rational and philosophical association of
ideas," may be developed and cultivated by a
little care and work. The first principle is
that of <i>learning the true relations of an idea</i>&mdash;its
various logical associations. Perhaps
the easiest and best method is that adopted
and practiced by Socrates, the old Greek
philosopher, often called "the Socratic
method"&mdash;the Method of Questioning. By
questioning oneself, or others, regarding a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
thing, the mind of the person answering tends
to unfold its stores of information, and to
make new and true associations. Kays says:
"Socrates, Plato, and others among the ancients
and some moderns, have been masters
of this art. The principle of asking questions
and obtaining answers to them may be said
to characterize all intellectual effort....
The great thing is to ask the right questions,
and to obtain the right answers." Meiklejohn
says: "This art of questioning possessed
by Dr. Hodgson was something wonderful and
unique, and was to the minds of most of his
pupils a truly obstetric art. He told them little
or nothing, but showed them how to find out
for themselves. 'The Socratic method,' he
said, 'is the true one, especially with the
young.'"</p>

<p>But this questioning must be done logically,
and orderly, and not in a haphazard way. As
Fitch says: "In proposing questions it is very
necessary to keep in view the importance of
arranging them in the exact order in which
the subject would naturally develop itself in
the mind of a logical and systematic thinker."
A number of systems have been formulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
by different writers on the subject, all of
which have much merit. The following System
of Analysis, designed for the use of students
desiring to acquire correct associations,
was given in the volume of this series, entitled
"Memory," and is reproduced here because
it is peculiarly adapted to the cultivation
and development of the faculty of discovering
and forming correct associations
and relations between ideas:</p>

questions about it, examining each
point in detail, and endeavoring to bring before
the mind <i>your full knowledge</i> regarding
that particular point. Fill in the deficiencies
by reading some good work of reference, an
encyclopedia for instance; or consulting a
good dictionary, or both:</p>

<p>The following "Query Table," from the

direction. It is simpler and less complicated
than the system given above. It has well been
called a "Magic Key of Knowledge," and it
opens many a mental door:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Remember, always, that the greater the

you are able to group around a concept, the
richer, fuller and truer does that concept become
to you. The concept is a <i>general idea</i>,
and its attributes of "generality" depend
upon the associated facts and ideas related to
it. The greater the number of the view points
from which a concept may be examined and
considered, the greater is the degree of knowledge
concerning that concept. It is held that
everything in the universe is related to every
other thing, so that if we knew <i>all</i> the associated
ideas and facts concerning a thing, we
would not only know that particular thing <i>absolutely</i>,
but would, besides, know <i>everything</i>
in the universe. The chain of Association is
infinite in extent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="chap">GENERALIZATION</p>


<p>We have seen that Sensation is translated
or interpreted into Perception; and that from
the Percepts so created we may "draw off,"
or separate, various qualities, attributes and
properties by the analytical process we call
Abstraction. Abstraction, we have seen, thus
constitutes the first step in the process of what
is called Understanding. The second step is
called Generalization or Conception.</p>

<p>Generalization, or Conception, is that faculty
of the mind by which we are able to combine
and group together several particular
ideas into one general idea. Thus when we
find a number of particular objects possessing
the same general qualities, attributes or properties,
we proceed to <i>classify</i> them by the
process of Generalization. For instance, in a
number of animals possessing certain general
and common qualities we form a concept of a
class comprising those particular animals.
Thus in the concept of cow, we include <i>all cows</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>&mdash;we
know them to be cows because of their
possession of certain general class qualities
which we include in our concept of <i>cow</i>. The
particular cows may vary greatly in size,
color and general appearance, but they possess
the common general qualities which we
group together in our general concept of <i>cow</i>.
Likewise by reason of certain common and
general qualities we include in our concept of
"Man," <i>all men</i>, black, white, brown, red or
yellow, of all races and degrees of physical
and mental development. From this generic
concept we may make race concepts, dividing
men into Indians, Caucasians, Malays, Negroes,
Mongolians, etc. These concepts in turn
may be divided into sub-races. These sub-divisions
result from an analysis of the great concept.
The great concept is built up by synthesis
from the individuals, through the sub-divisions
of minor concepts. Or, again, we may
form a concept of "Napoleon Bonaparte"
from the various qualities and characteristics
which went to make up that celebrated man.</p>

<p>The product of Generalization or Conception
is called a <i>Concept</i>. A Concept is expressed
in a word, or words, called "A Term."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
A Concept is more than a mere <i>word</i>&mdash;it is <i>a
general idea</i>. And a Term is more than a
mere word&mdash;it is <i>the expression of a general
idea</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>Concept</i> is built up from the processes of
Perception, Abstraction, Comparison and
Generalization. We must first perceive; then
analyze or abstract qualities; then compare
qualities; then synthesize or classify according
to the result of the comparison of qualities.
By perceiving and comparing the qualities
of various individual things, we notice
their points of resemblance and difference&mdash;the
points wherein they agree or disagree&mdash;wherein
they are alike or unlike. Eliminating
by abstraction the points in which they differ
and are unlike; and, again by abstraction, retaining
in consideration the points in which
they resemble and are alike; we are able to
group, arrange or classify these "<i>alike
things</i>" into <i>a class-idea</i> large enough to embrace
them all. This class-idea is what is
known as a General Idea or a Concept. This
Concept we give a general name, which is
called a Term. In grammar our particular
ideas arising from Percepts are usually de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>noted
by proper nouns&mdash;our general ideas
arising from Concepts are usually denoted
by common nouns. Thus "John Smith" (particular;
proper noun) and "Man" (general;
common noun). Or "horse" (general; common),
and "Dobbin" (particular; proper).</p>

<p>It will be seen readily that there must be
lower and higher concepts. Every class contains
within itself lower classes. And every
class is, itself, but a lower class in a higher
one. Thus the high concept of "animal" may
be analyzed into "mammal," which in turn
is found to contain "horse," which in turn
may be sub-divided into special kinds of
horses. The concept "plant" may be sub-divided
many times before the concept "rose"
is obtained, and the latter is capable of sub-division
into varieties and sub-varieties, until
at last a particular flower is reached. Jevons
says: "We classify things together whenever
we observe that they are like each other in any
respect and, therefore, think of them together....
In classifying a collection of objects,
we do not merely put together into groups
those which resemble each other, but we also
divide each class into smaller ones in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the resemblance is more complete. Thus the
class of <i>white substances</i> may be divided into
those which are solid and those which are
fluid, so that we get the two minor classes of
solid-white, and fluid-white substances. It is
desirable to have names by which to show that
one class is contained in another and, accordingly,
we call the class which is divided into
two or more smaller ones, the <i>Genus</i>; and the
smaller ones into which it is divided, the
<i>Species</i>."</p>

<p>Every Genus is a Species of the class next
higher than itself; and every Species is a
Genus of the classes lower than itself. Thus
it would seem that the extension in either direction
would be infinite. But, for the purposes
of finite thought, the authorities teach
that there must be a Highest Genus, which
cannot be the Species of a higher class, and
which is called the <i>Summum Genus</i>. The
<i>Summum Genus</i> is expressed by terms such
as the following: "Being;" "Existence;"
"The Absolute;" "Something;" "Thing;"
"The Ultimate Reality," or some similar term
denoting the state of being <i>ultimate</i>. Likewise,
at the lowest end of the scale we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
what are called the Lowest Species, or <i>Infima
Species</i>. The Infima Species are always <i>individuals</i>.
Thus we have the <i>individual</i> at one
end of the scale; and <i>The Absolute</i> at the
other. Beyond these limits the mind of man
cannot travel.</p>

<p>There has been much confusion in making
classifications and some ingenious plans have
been evolved for simplifying the process.
That of Jevons is perhaps the simplest, when
understood. This authority says: "All these
difficulties are avoided in the <i>perfect logical
method of dividing each Genus into two Species,
and not more than two, so that one species
possesses a particular quality, and the other
does not</i>. Thus if I divide dwelling-houses
into those which are made of brick and those
which are not made of brick, I am perfectly
safe and nobody can find fault with me....
Suppose, for instance, that I divide dwelling-houses
as below:</p>

<p>"The evident objection will at once be made,

houses are sometimes made of the bark of
gum-trees; the Esquimaux live in snow
houses; tents may be considered as canvas
houses, and it is easy to conceive of houses
made of terra-cotta, paper, straw, etc. All
logical difficulties will, however, be avoided <i>if

<p>"It is quite certain that I must in this division
have left a place for every possible kind
of house; for if a house is not made of brick,
nor stone, nor wood, nor iron, it yet comes under
the species at the right hand, which is not-iron,
not-wooden, not-stone, and not-brick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>...
This manner of classifying things may
seem to be inconvenient, but it is in reality the
only logical way."</p>

<p>The student will see that the process of
Classification is two-fold. The first is by
Analysis, in which the Genus is divided into
Species by reason of <i>differences</i>. The second
is by Synthesis, in which individuals are
grouped into Species, and Species into the
Genus, by reason of <i>resemblances</i>. Moreover,
in building up general classes, which is known
as Generalization, we must first <i>analyze</i> the
individual in order to ascertain its <i>qualities,
attributes and properties</i>, and then <i>synthesize</i>
the individual with other individuals possessing
like qualities, properties or attributes.</p>

<p>Brooks says of Generalization: "The mind
now takes the materials that have been furnished
and fashioned by comparison and
analysis and unites them into one single mental
product, giving us the general notion or
concept. The mind, as it were, brings together
these several attributes into a bunch or
package and then ties a mental string around
it, as we would bunch a lot of roses or cigars....
Generalization is an <i>ascending</i> process.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
The broader concept is regarded as higher
than the narrower concept; a concept is considered
as higher than percept; a general
idea stands above a particular idea. We thus
go up from particulars to generals; from percepts
to concepts; from lower concepts to
higher concepts. Beginning down with particular
objects, we rise from them to the general
idea of their class. Having formed a
number of lower classes, we compare them as
we did individuals and generalize them into
higher classes. We perform the same process
with these higher classes and thus proceed until
we are at last arrested in the highest class,
that of Being. Having reached the pinnacle
of Generalization, we may descend the ladder
by reversing the process through which we
ascend."</p>

<p>A Concept, then, is seen to be a <i>general idea</i>.
It is a general thought that embraces <i>all the
individuals</i> of its own class and has in it all
that is common to its own class, while it resembles
<i>no</i> particular individual of its class
in <i>all</i> respects. Thus, a concept of <i>animal</i> contains
within itself the minor concepts of <i>all
animals</i> and the animal-quality of all animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>&mdash;yet
it differs from the <i>percept</i> of any one
particular animal and the minor concepts of
minor classes of animals. Consequently a
concept or general idea cannot be <i>imaged</i> or
mentally pictured. We may picture a percept
of any particular thing, but we cannot picture
a general idea or concept because the latter
does not partake of the <i>particular</i> qualities of
any of its class, but embraces all the general
qualities of the class. Try to picture the general
idea, or concept, of Man. You will find
that any attempt to do so will result in the
production of merely <i>a man</i>&mdash;some particular
man. If you give the picture dark hair, it will
fail to include the light-haired men; if you
give it white skin, it will slight the darker-skinned
races. If you picture a stout man,
the thin ones are neglected. And so on in
every feature. It is impossible to form a correct
general class picture unless we include
every individual in it. The best we can do is
to form a sort of <i>composite</i> image, which at
the best is in the nature of a symbol representative
of the class&mdash;an ideal image to make
easier the <i>idea</i> of the general class or term.</p>

<p>From the above we may see the fundamen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>tal
differences between a Percept and a Concept.
The Percept is the mental image of a
real object&mdash;a particular thing. The Concept
is merely a <i>general idea</i>, or general notion, of
the common attributes of a class of objects or
things. A Percept arises directly from sense-impressions,
while a Concept is, in a sense, a
pure thought&mdash;an abstract thing&mdash;a mental
creation&mdash;an ideal.</p>

<p>A Concrete Concept is a concept embodying
the common qualities of a class of objects, as
for instance, the concrete concept of <i>lion</i>, in
which the general class qualities of all lions
are embodied. An Abstract Concept is a concept
embodying merely some one quality generally
diffused, as for instance, the quality of
<i>fierceness</i> in the general class of lions. <i>Rose</i>
is a concrete concept; <i>red</i>, or <i>redness</i>, is an
abstract concept. It will aid you in remembering
this distinction to memorize Jevons' rule:
"<i>A Concrete Term is the name of a Thing</i>; <i>an
Abstract Term is the name of a Quality of a
Thing</i>."</p>

<p>A Concrete Concept, including all the particular
individuals of a class, must also contain
all the common qualities of those individ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>uals.
Thus, such a concept is composed of the
ideas of the particular individuals and of their
common qualities, in combination and union.
From this arises the distinctive terms known
as the <i>content</i>, <i>extension</i> and <i>intension</i> of concepts,
respectively.</p>

<p>The <i>content</i> of a concept is <i>all that it includes&mdash;its
full meaning</i>. The <i>extension</i> of a
concept depends upon its <i>quantity</i> aspect&mdash;it
is its property of including numbers of individual
objects within its content. The <i>intension</i>
of a concept depends upon its <i>quality</i> aspect&mdash;it
is its property of including class or
common qualities, properties or attributes
within its content.</p>

<p>Thus, the <i>extension</i> of the concept <i>horse</i>
covers all individual horses; while its <i>intension</i>
includes all qualities, attributes, and
properties common to all horses&mdash;class qualities
possessed by all horses in common, and
which qualities, etc., make the particular animals
<i>horses</i>, as distinguished from other animals.</p>

<p>It follows that the larger the number of particular
objects in a class, the smaller must be
the number of general class qualities&mdash;quali<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>ties
common to all in the class. And, that the
larger the number of common class qualities,
the smaller must be the number of individuals
in the class. As the logicians express it, "the
greater the extension, the less the intension;
the greater the intension, the less the extension."
Thus, <i>animal</i> is narrow in intension,
but very broad in extension; for while there
are many animals there are but very few qualities
common to <i>all</i> animals. And, <i>horse</i> is
narrower in extension, but broader in intension;
for while there are comparatively few
horses, the qualities common to all horses are
greater.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the faculty of Generalization,
or Conception, of course, depends
largely upon <i>exercise</i> and <i>material</i>, as does
the cultivation of every mental faculty, as we
have seen. But there are certain rules, methods
and ideas which may be used to advantage
in developing this faculty in the direction of
clear and capable work. This faculty is developed
by all of the general processes of
thought, for it forms an important part of all
thought. But the logical processes known as
Analysis and Synthesis give to this faculty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
exercise and employment particularly adapted
to its development and cultivation. Let us
briefly consider these processes.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>Logical Analysis</i> is the process by which we
examine and unfold the meaning of Terms. A
Term, you remember, is the verbal expression
of a Concept. In such analysis we endeavor
to unfold and discover the <i>quality-aspect</i> and
the <i>quantity-aspect</i> of the content of the concept.
We seek, thereby, to discover the particular
general idea expressed; the number of
particular individuals included therein; and
the properties of the class or generalization.
Analysis depends upon division and separation.
Development in the process of Logical
Analysis tends toward clearness, distinctness,
and exactness in thought and expression.
Logical Analysis has two aspects or phases,
as follows: (1) <i>Division</i>, or the separation of
a concept according to its <i>extension</i>, as for instance
the analysis of a genus into its various
species; and (2) <i>Partition</i>, or the separation
of a concept into its component qualities, properties
and attributes, as for instance, the analysis
of the concept <i>iron</i> into its several qual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>ities
of color, weight, hardness, malleability,
tenacity, utility, etc.</p>

<p>There are certain rules of Division which
should be observed, the following being a simple
statement of the same:</p>

<p>I. <i>The division should be governed by a uniform
principle.</i> For instance it would be illogical
to first divide men into Caucasians,
Mongolians, etc., and then further sub-divide
them into Christians, Pagans, etc., for the first
division would be according to the principle of
race, and the second according to the principle
of religion. Observing the rule of the "uniform
principle" we may divide men into races,
and sub-races, and so on, without regard to
religion; and we may likewise divide men according
to their respective religions, and then
into minor denominations and sects, without
regard to race or nationality. The above rule
is frequently violated by careless thinkers and
speakers.</p>

<p>II. <i>The division should be complete and
exhaustive.</i> For instance, the analysis of a
genus should extend to every known species
of it, upon the principle that <i>the genus is
merely the sum of its several species</i>. A text<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>book
illustration of a violation of this rule is
given in the case of the concept <i>actions</i>, when
divided into <i>good-actions</i> and <i>bad-actions</i>, but
omitting the very important species of <i>indifferent-actions</i>.
Carelessness in observance
of this rule leads to fallacious reasoning and
cloudy thinking.</p>

<p>III. <i>The division should be in logical sequence.</i>
It is illogical to skip or pass over intermediate
divisions, as for instance, when we
divide <i>animals</i> into <i>horses</i>, <i>trout and swallows</i>,
omitting the intermediate division into
<i>mammals</i>, <i>fish and birds</i>. The more perfect
the sequence, the clearer the analysis and the
thought resulting therefrom.</p>

<p>IV. <i>The division should be exclusive.</i>
That is, the various species divided from a
genus, should be reciprocally exclusive&mdash;should
exclude one another. Thus to divide
<i>mankind</i> into <i>male</i>, <i>men and women</i>, would be
illogical, because the class <i>male</i> includes <i>men</i>.
The division should be either: "<i>male and female</i>;"
or else: "men, women, boys, girls."</p>

<p>The exercise of Division along these lines,
and according to these rules, will tend to improve
one's powers of conception and analy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>sis.
Any class of objects&mdash;any general concept&mdash;may
be used for practice. A trial will
show you the great powers of unfoldment contained
within this simple process. It tends to
broaden and widen one's conception of almost
any class of objects.</p>

<p>There are also several rules for Partition
which should be observed, as follows:</p>

<p>I. <i>The partition should be complete and
exhaustive.</i> That is, it should unfold the full
meaning of the term or concept, so far as is
concerned its several general qualities, properties
and attributes. But this applies only
to the qualities, properties and attributes
which are <i>common</i> to the class or concept, and
not to the minor qualities which belong solely
to the various sub-divisions composing the
class; nor to the accidental or individual qualities
belonging to the separate individuals in
any sub-class. The qualities should be <i>essential</i>
and not <i>accidental</i>&mdash;general, not particular.
A famous violation of this rule was had
in the case of the ancient Platonic definition
of "Man" as: "A two-legged animal without
feathers," which Diogenes rendered absurd
by offering a plucked chicken as a "man" ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>cording
to the definition. Clearness in
thought requires the recognition of the distinction
between the general qualities and the
individual, particular or accidental qualities.
Red-hair is an accidental quality of a particular
man and not a general quality of the class
<i>man</i>.</p>

<p>II. <i>The partition should consider the qualities,
properties and attributes</i>, according to
the classification of logical division. That is,
the various qualities, properties and attributes
should be considered in the form of
genus and species, as in Division. In this
classification, the rules of Division apply.</p>

<p>It will be seen that there is a close relationship
existing between Partition and Definition.
Definition is really a statement of the
various qualities, attributes, and properties of
a concept, either stated in particular or else
in concepts of other and larger classes. There
is perhaps no better exercise for the cultivation
of clear thought and conception than Definition.
In order to define, one must exercise
his power of analysis to a considerable extent.
Brooks says: "Exercises in logical definition
are valuable in unfolding our conception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Logical definition, including both the genus
and the specific difference, gives clearness,
definiteness and adequacy to our conceptions.
It separates a conception from all other conceptions
by fixing upon and presenting the essential
and distinctive property or properties
of the conception defined. The value of exercises
in logical definition is thus readily
apparent."</p>

<p>If the student will select some familiar term
and endeavor to define it correctly, writing
down the result, and will then compare the
latter with the definition given in some standard
dictionary, he will see a new light regarding
logical definition. Practice in definition,
conducted along these lines, will cultivate the
powers of analysis and conception and will,
at the same time, tend toward the acquiring of
correct and scientific methods of thought and
clear expression.</p>

<p>Hyslop gives the following excellent Rules
of Logical Definition, which should be followed
by the student in his exercises:</p>

<p>"I. A definition should state the essential
attributes of the species defined.</p>

<p>"II. A definition must not contain the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
or word defined. Otherwise the definition is
called <i>a circulus in definiendo</i> (defining in a
circle).</p>

<p>"III. The definition must be exactly equivalent
to the species defined.</p>

<p>"IV. A definition should not be expressed
in obscure, figurative or ambiguous language.</p>

<p>"V. A definition must not be negative
when it can be affirmative."</p>

<p><i>Logical Synthesis</i> is the exact opposite of
Logical Analysis. In the latter we strive to
separate and take apart; in the former we
strive to bind together and combine the particulars
into the general. Beginning with individual
things and comparing them with each
other according to observed points of resemblance,
we proceed to group them into species
or narrow classes. These classes, or species,
we then combine with similar ones, into a
larger class or genus; and then, according to
the same process, into broader classes as we
have shown in the first part of this chapter.</p>

<p>The process of Synthesis is calculated to
develop and cultivate the mind in several directions
and exercises along these lines will
give a new habit and sense of orderly arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>ment,
which will be most useful to the student
in his every-day life. Halleck says: "Whenever
a person is comparing a specimen to see
whether it may be put in the same class with
other specimens, he is <i>thinking</i>. Comparison
is an absolutely essential factor of thought,
and classification demands comparison. The
man who has not properly classified the myriad
individual objects with which he has to
deal, must advance like a cripple. He, only,
can travel with seven-league boots, who has
thought out the relations existing between
these stray individuals and put them into their
proper classes. In a minute a business man
may put his hand on any one of ten thousand
letters if they are properly classified. In the
same way, the student of history, sociology or
any other branch, can, if he studies the subjects
aright, have all his knowledge classified
and speedily available for use.... In this
way, we may make our knowledge of the world
more minutely exact. We cannot classify
without seeing things under a new aspect."</p>

<p>The study of Natural History, in any or all
of its branches, will do much to cultivate the
power of Classification. But one may prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>tice
classification with the objects around him
in his every-day life. Arranging things mentally,
into small classes, and these into larger,
one will soon be able to form a logical connection
between particular ideas and general
ideas; particular objects and general classes.
The practice of classification gives to the mind
a constructive turn&mdash;a "building-up" tendency,
which is most desirable in these days of
construction and development. Regarding
some of the pitfalls of classification, Jevons
says:</p>

<p>"In classifying things, we must take great
care not to be misled by outward resemblances.
Things may seem to be very much like each
other which are not so. Whales, porpoises,
seals and several other animals live in the sea
exactly like fish; they have a similar shape
and are usually classed among fish. People
are said to go whale-fishing. Yet these animals
are not really fish at all, but are much
more like dogs and horses and other quadrupeds
than they are like fish. They cannot live
entirely under water and breathe the air contained
in the water like fish, but they have to
come up to the surface at intervals to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
breath. Similarly, we must not class bats
with birds because they fly about, although
they have what would be called wings; these
wings are not like those of birds and in truth
bats are much more like rats and mice than
they are like birds. Botanists used at one
time to classify plants according to their size,
as trees, shrubs or herbs, but we now know
that a great tree is often more similar in its
character to a tiny herb than it is to other
great trees. A daisy has little resemblance
to a great Scotch thistle; yet the botanist regards
them as very similar. The lofty growing
bamboo is a kind of grass, and the sugarcane
also belongs to the same class with wheat
and oats."</p>

<p>Remember that analysis of a genus into its
component species is accomplished by a separation
according to <i>differences</i>; and species
are built up by synthesis into a genus because
of <i>resemblances</i>. The same is true regarding
individual and species, building up in accordance
to points of resemblance, while analysis
or separation is according to points of difference.</p>

<p>The use of a good dictionary will be advan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>tageous
to the student in developing the power
of Generalization or Conception. Starting
with a species, he may build up to higher and
still higher classes by consulting the dictionary;
likewise, starting with a large class, he
may work down to the several species composing
it. An encyclopedia, of course, is still
better for the purpose in many cases. Remember
that Generalization is a prime requisite
for clear, logical thinking. Moreover, it
is a great developer of Thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="chap">JUDGMENT</p>


<p>We have seen that in the several mental
processes which are grouped together under
the general head of Understanding, the stage
or step of Abstraction is first; following which
is the second step or phase, called Generalization
or Conception. The third step or phase
is that which is called Judgment. In the exercise
of the faculty of Judgment, we determine
the agreement or disagreement between two
concepts, ideas, or objects of thought, by comparing
them one with another. From this
process of comparison arises the Judgment,
which is expressed in the shape of a logical
Proposition. A certain form of Judgment
must be used, however, in the actual formation
of a Concept, for we must first compare
qualities, and make a judgment thereon, in
order to form a general idea. In this place,
however, we shall confine ourselves to the consideration
of the faculty of Judgment in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
strictly logical usage of the term, as previously
stated.</p>

<p>We have seen that the expression of a concept
is called a Term, which is the <i>name</i> of
the concept. In the same way when we compare
two terms (expressions of concepts) and
pass Judgment thereon, the expression of
that Judgment is called a Proposition. In
every Judgment and Proposition there must
be two Terms or Concepts, connected by a
little word "is" or "are," or some form of
the verb "to be," in the present tense indicative.
This connecting word is called the
Copula. For instance, we may compare the
two terms <i>horse</i> and <i>animal</i>, as follows: "A
horse is an animal," the word <i>is</i> being the
Copula or symbol of the <i>affirmative</i> Judgment,
which connects the two terms. In the
same way we may form a <i>negative</i> Judgment
as follows: "A horse is not a cow." In a
Proposition, <i>the term of which something is
affirmed</i> is called the Subject; and <i>the term
expressing that which is affirmed of the subject</i>
is called the Predicate.</p>

<p>Besides the distinction between affirmative
Judgments, or Propositions, there is a dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>tinction
arising from <i>quantity</i>, which separates
them into the respective classes of <i>particular</i>
and <i>universal</i>. Thus, "<i>all</i> horses are
animals," is a <i>universal</i> Judgment; while
"<i>some</i> horses are black" is a particular Judgment.
Thus all Judgments must be either <i>affirmative</i>
or <i>negative</i>; and also either <i>particular</i>
or <i>universal</i>. This gives us four possible
classes of Judgments, as follows, and illustrated
symbolically:</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang2">1. Universal Affirmative, as "All A is B."</p>

<p class="hang2">2. Universal Negative, as "No A is B."</p>

<p class="hang2">3. Particular Affirmative, as "Some A is
B."</p>

<p class="hang2">4. Particular Negative, as "Some A is not
B."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Term or Judgment is said to be "<i>distributed</i>"
(that is, extended universally)
when it is used in its fullest sense, in which
it is used in the sense of "each and every" of
its kind or class. Thus in the proposition
"Horses are animals" the meaning is that
"<i>each and every</i>" horse is an animal&mdash;in this
case the <i>subject</i> is "distributed" or made
universal. But the <i>predicate</i> is <i>not</i> "distributed"
or made universal, but remains partic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>ular
or restricted and implies merely "some."
For the proposition does not mean that the
class "<i>horses</i>" includes <i>all</i> animals. For we
may say that: "<i>Some</i> animals are <i>not</i> horses."
So you see we have several instances in which
the "distribution" varies, both as regards the
subject and also the predicate. The rule of
logic applying in this case is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang2">1. In <i>universal</i> propositions, the <i>subject</i> is
distributed.</p>

<p class="hang2">2. In <i>particular</i> propositions, the <i>subject</i> is
<i>not</i> distributed.</p>

<p class="hang2">3. In <i>negative</i> propositions, the <i>predicate</i>
is distributed.</p>

<p class="hang2">4. In <i>affirmative</i> propositions, the <i>predicate</i>
is <i>not</i> distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>A little time devoted to the analysis and understanding
of the above rules will repay the
student for his trouble, inasmuch as it will
train his mind in the direction of logical distinction
and judgment. The importance of
these rules will appear later.</p>

<p>Halleck says: "Judgment is the power
revolutionizing the world. The revolution is
slow because nature's forces are so complex,
so hard to be reduced to their simplest forms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and so disguised and neutralized by the presence
of other forces. The progress of the next
hundred years will join many concepts, which
now seem to have no common qualities. If
the vast amount of energy latent in the sunbeams,
in the rays of the stars, in the winds,
in the rising and falling of the tides, is treasured
up and applied to human purposes, it
will be a fresh triumph for judgment. This
world is rolling around in a universe of energy,
of which judgment has as yet harnessed
only the smallest appreciable fraction. Fortunately,
judgment is ever working and
silently comparing things that, to past ages,
have seemed dissimilar; and it is constantly
abstracting and leaving out of the field of view
those qualities which have simply served to
obscure the point at issue." Brooks says:
"The power of judgment is of great value to
its products. It is involved in or accompanies
every act of the intellect, and thus lies at the
foundation of all intellectual activity. It operates
directly in every act of the understanding;
and even aids the other faculties of the
mind in completing their activities and
products."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>The best method of cultivating the power
of Judgment is the exercise of the faculty in
the direction of making comparisons, of
weighing differences and resemblances, and
in generally training the mind along the lines
of Logical Thinking. Another volume of this
series is devoted to the latter subject, and
should aid the student who wishes to cultivate
the habit of logical and scientific thought.
The study of mathematics is calculated to
develop the faculty of Judgment, because it
necessitates the use of the powers of comparison
and decision. Mental arithmetic, especially,
will tend to strengthen, and exercise
this faculty of the mind.</p>

<p>Geometry and Logic will give the very best
exercise along these lines to those who care
to devote the time, attention and work to the
task. Games, such as chess, and checkers or
draughts, tend to develop the powers of Judgment.
The study of the definitions of words
in a good dictionary will also tend to give excellent
exercise along the same lines. The exercises
given in this book for the cultivation
and development of the several faculties, will
tend to develop this particular faculty in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
general way, for the exercise of Judgment is
required at each step of the way, and in each
exercise.</p>

<p>Brooks says: "It should be one of the leading
objects of the culture of young people to
lead them to acquire the habit of forming
judgments. They should not only be led to see
things, but to have opinions about things.
They should be trained to see things in their
relations, and to put these relations into definite
propositions. Their ideas of objects
should be worked up into thoughts concerning
the objects. Those methods of teaching
are best which tend to excite a thoughtful habit
of mind that notices the similitudes and diversities
of objects, and endeavors to read the
thoughts which they embody and of which they
are the symbols."</p>

<p>The exercises given at the close of the next
chapter, entitled "Derived Judgments," will
give to the mind a decided trend in the direction
of logical judgment. We heartily recommend
them to the student.</p>

<p>The student will find that he will tend to

and judgment, if he will memorize and apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
in his thinking the following excellent <i>Primary
Rules of Thought</i>, stated by Jevons:</p>

<p>"I. <i>Law of Identity</i>: The same quality or
thing is <i>always</i> the same quality or thing, no
matter how different the conditions in which
it occurs.</p>

<p>"II. <i>Law of Contradiction</i>: Nothing can at
the same time and place <i>both</i> be and not be.</p>

<p>"III. <i>Law of Excluded Middle</i>: Everything
must <i>either</i> be, or not be; there is no other
alternative or middle course."</p>

<p>Jevons says of these laws: "Students are
seldom able to see at first their full meaning
and importance. All arguments may be explained
when these self-evident laws are
granted; and it is not too much to say that
<i>the whole of logic will be plain to those who
will constantly use these laws as their key</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">DERIVED JUDGMENTS</p>


<p>As we have seen, a Judgment is obtained by
comparing two objects of thought according
to their agreement or difference. The next
higher step, that of logical Reasoning, consists
of the comparing of two ideas through
their relation to a third. This form of reasoning
is called <i>mediate</i>, because it is effected
through the <i>medium</i> of the third idea. There
is, however, a certain process of Understanding
which comes in between this mediate reasoning
on the one hand, and the formation of
a plain judgment on the other. Some authorities
treat it as a form of <i>reasoning</i>, calling it
<i>Immediate Reasoning</i> or Immediate Inference,
while others treat it as a higher form
of Judgment, calling it Derived Judgment.
We shall follow the latter classification, as
best adapted for the particular purposes of
this book.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle of Derived
Judgment is that ordinary Judgments are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
often so related to each other that one Judgment
may be derived directly and immediately
from another. The two particular forms of
the general method of Derived Judgment are
known as those of (1) Opposition; and (2)
Conversion; respectively.</p>

<p>In order to more clearly understand the
logical processes involved in Derived Judgment,
we should acquaint ourselves with the
general relations of Judgments, and with the
symbolic letters used by logicians as a means
of simplifying the processes of thought. Logicians
denote each of the four classes of Judgments
or Propositions by a certain letter, the
first four vowels&mdash;A, E, I and O, being used
for the purpose. It has been found very convenient
to use these symbols in denoting the
various forms of Propositions and Judgments.
The following table should be memorized
for this purpose:</p>

<blockquote><p class="noin">
<i>Universal Affirmative</i>, symbolized by "A."<br />
<i>Universal Negative</i>, symbolized by "E."<br />
<i>Particular Affirmative</i>, symbolized by "I."<br />
<i>Particular Negative</i>, symbolized by "O."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be seen that these four forms of
Judgments bear certain relations to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
other, from which arises what is called opposition.
This may be better understood by reference
to the following table called the Square
of Opposition:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="350" height="353" alt="chart"
title="CONTRARIES: A/ E, SUBALTERNS, CONTRADICTORIES, SUBCONTRARIES: I/ O" />
</div>





<p>Thus, A and E are <i>contraries</i>; I and O are
<i>sub-contraries</i>; A and I, and also E and O are
<i>subalterns</i>; A and O, and also E and I are
<i>contradictories</i>.</p>

<p>The following will give a symbolic table of
each of the four Judgments or Propositions
with the logical symbols attached:</p>

<p>(A) "All A is B."</p>

<p>(E)  "No A is B."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>(I) "Some A is B."</p>

<p>(O) "Some A is not B."</p>

<p>The following are the rules governing and
expressing the relations above indicated:</p>

<p>I. Of the Contradictories: <i>One must be
true, and the other must be false</i>. As for
instance, (A) "All A is B;" and (O) "Some
A is not B;" cannot both be true at the same
time. Neither can (E) "No A is B;" and (I)
"Some A is B;" both be true at the same time.
They are <i>contradictory</i> by nature,&mdash;and if one
is true, the other must be false; if one is false,
the other must be true.</p>

<p>II. Of the Contraries: <i>If one is true the
other must be false; but, both may be false</i>.
As for instance, (A) "All A is B;" and (E)
"No A is B;" cannot both be true at the same
time. If one is true the other <i>must</i> be false.
<i>But</i>, both may be <i>false</i>, as we may see when
we find we may state that (I) "<i>Some</i> A is B."
So while these two propositions are <i>contrary</i>,
they are not <i>contradictory</i>. While, if one of
them is <i>true</i> the other must be false, it does
not follow that if one is <i>false</i> the other must
be <i>true</i>, for both <i>may be false</i>, leaving the
truth to be found in a third proposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>III. Of the Subcontraries: <i>If one is false
the other must be true; but both may be true</i>.
As for instance, (I) "Some A is B;" and (O)
"Some A is not B;" may both be true, for
they do not contradict each other. But one
or the other must be true&mdash;they can not both
be false.</p>

<p>IV. Of the Subalterns: <i>If the Universal
(A or E) be true the Particular (I or O)
must be true</i>. As for instance, if (A) "All A
is B" is true, then (I) "Some A is B" must
also be true; also, if (E) "No A is B" is true,
then "Some A is not B" must also be true.
The Universal carries the particular within
its truth and meaning. But; <i>If the Universal
is false, the particular may be true or it may
be false</i>. As for instance (A) "All A is B"
may be false, and yet (I) "Some A is B" may
be either true or false, without being determined
by the (A) proposition. And, likewise,
(E) "No A is B" may be false without determining
the truth or falsity of (O) "Some
A is not B."</p>

<p>But: <i>If the Particular be false, the Universal
also must be false</i>. As for instance,
if (I) "Some A is B" is false, then it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
follow that (A) "All A is B" must also be
false; or if (O) "Some A is not B" is false,
then (E) "No A is B" must also be false.
But: <i>The Particular may be true, without rendering
the Universal true</i>. As for instance:
(I) "<i>Some</i> A is B" may be true without making
true (A) "<i>All</i> A is B;" or (O) "Some A
is not B" may be true without making true
(E) "No A is B."</p>

<p>The above rules may be worked out not only
with the symbols, as "All A is B," but also
with <i>any</i> Judgments or Propositions, such as
"All horses are animals;" "All men are
mortal;" "Some men are artists;" etc. The
principle involved is identical in each and
every case. The "All A is B" symbology is
merely adopted for simplicity, and for the
purpose of rendering the logical process akin
to that of mathematics. The letters play the
same part that the numerals or figures do in
arithmetic or the <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>; <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, in algebra.
Thinking in symbols tends toward clearness
of thought and reasoning.</p>

<p><i>Exercise</i>: Let the student apply the principles
of Opposition by using any of the above
judgments mentioned in the preceding para<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>graph,
in the direction of erecting a Square of
Opposition of them, after having attached
the symbolic letters A, E, I and O, to the appropriate
forms of the propositions.</p>

<p>Then let him work out the following problems
from the Tables and Square given in this
chapter.</p>

<p>1. If "A" is true; show what follows for E,
I and O. Also what follows if "A" be <i>false</i>.</p>

<p>2. If "E" is true; show what follows for A,
I and O. Also what follows if "E" be <i>false</i>.</p>

<p>3. If "I" is true; show what follows for A,
E and O. Also what follows if "I" be <i>false</i>.</p>

<p>4. If "O" is true; show what follows for A,
E and I. Also what happens if "O" be <i>false</i>.</p>


<h3>CONVERSION OF JUDGMENTS</h3>

<p>Judgments are capable of the process of
Conversion, or <i>the change of place of subject
and predicate</i>. Hyslop says: "Conversion
is the transposition of subject and predicate,
or the process of immediate inference by
which we can infer from a given preposition
another having the predicate of the original
for its subject, and the subject of the original
for its predicate." The process of converting
a proposition seems simple at first thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
but a little consideration will show that there
are many difficulties in the way. For instance,
while it is a true judgment that "All <i>horses</i>
are <i>animals</i>," it is not a correct Derived Judgment
or Inference that "All <i>animals</i> are
<i>horses</i>." The same is true of the possible conversion
of the judgment "All biscuit is
bread" into that of "All bread is biscuit."
There are certain rules to be observed in Conversion,
as we shall see in a moment.</p>

<p>The Subject of a judgment is, of course, <i>the
term of which something is affirmed</i>; and the
Predicate is <i>the term expressing that which is
affirmed of the Subject</i>. The Predicate is
really an expression of an <i>attribute</i> of the
Subject. Thus when we say "All horses are
animals" we express the idea that <i>all horses</i>
possess the <i>attribute</i> of "animality;" or when
we say that "Some men are artists," we express
the idea that <i>some men</i> possess the <i>attributes</i>
or qualities included in the concept
"artist." In Conversion, the original judgment
is called the Convertend; and the new
form of judgment, resulting from the conversion,
is called the Converse. Remember these
terms, please.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>The two Rules of Conversion, stated in
simple form, are as follows:</p>

<p>I. Do not change the quality of a judgment.
The quality of the converse must remain the
same as that of the convertend.</p>

<p>II. Do not distribute an undistributed
term. No term must be distributed in the converse
which is not distributed in the convertend.</p>

<p>The reason of these rules is that it would
be contrary to truth and logic to give to a
converted judgment a higher degree of quality
and quantity than is found in the original
judgment. To do so would be to attempt to
make "twice 2" more than "2 plus 2."</p>

<p>There are three methods or kinds of Conversion,
as follows: (1) Simple Conversion;
(2) Limited Conversion; and (3) Conversion
by Contraposition.</p>

<p><i>In Simple Conversion</i>, there is no change in
either quality or quantity. For instance, by
Simple Conversion we may convert a proposition
by changing the places of its subject and
predicate, respectively. But as Jevons says:
"It does not follow that the new one will always
be true if the old one was true. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>times
this is the case, and sometimes it is not.
If I say, 'some churches are wooden-buildings,'
I may turn it around and get 'some
wooden-buildings are churches;' the meaning
is exactly the same as before. This kind of
change is called Simple Conversion, because
we need do nothing but simply change the subjects
and predicates in order to get a new
proposition. We see that the Particular Affirmative
proposition can be simply converted.
Such is the case also with the Universal Negative
proposition. 'No large flowers are green
things' may be converted simply into 'no
green things are large flowers.'"</p>

<p><i>In Limited Conversion</i>, the quantity is
changed from Universal to Particular. Of this,
Jevons continues: "But it is a more troublesome
matter, however, to convert a Universal
Affirmative proposition. The statement that
'all jelly fish are animals,' is true; but, if we
convert it, getting 'all animals are jelly fish,'
the result is absurd. This is because the predicate
of a universal proposition is really particular.
We do not mean that jelly fish are
'all' the animals which exist, but only 'some'
of the animals. The proposition ought really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
to be 'all jelly fish are <i>some</i> animals,' and if
we converted this simply, we should get, 'some
animals are all jelly fish.' But we almost always
leave out the little adjectives <i>some</i> and
<i>all</i> when they would occur in the predicate,
so that the proposition, when converted, becomes
'<i>some</i> animals are jelly fish.' This
kind of change is called Limited Conversion,
and we see that a Universal Affirmative proposition,
when so converted, gives a Particular
Affirmative one."</p>

<p>In Conversion by Contraposition, there is
a change in the position of the negative copula,
which shifts the expression of the quality.
As for instance, in the Particular Negative
"Some animals are not horses," we cannot
say "Some horses are not animals," for that
would be a violation of the rule that "no term
must be distributed in the converse which is
not distributed in the convertend," for as
we have seen in the preceding chapter: "In
Particular propositions the <i>subject</i> is <i>not</i> distributed."
And in the original proposition,
or convertend, "animals" is the <i>subject</i> of a
Particular proposition. Avoiding this, and
proceeding by Conversion by Contraposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
we convert the Convertend (O) into a Particular
Affirmative (I), saying: "Some animals
are not-horses;" or "Some animals are
things not horses;" and then proceeding by
Simple Conversion we get the converse,
"Some things not horses are animals," or
"Some not-horses are animals."</p>

<p>The following gives the application of the
appropriate form of Conversion to each of
the several four kind of Judgments or Propositions:</p>

<p>(A) <i>Universal Affirmative</i>: This form of
proposition is converted by Limited Conversion.
The predicate not being distributed in
the convertend, it cannot be distributed in the
converse, by saying "all." ("In affirmative
propositions the <i>predicate</i> is <i>not</i> distributed.")
Thus by this form of Conversion, we
convert "All horses are animals" into "Some
animals are horses." The Universal Affirmative
(A) is converted by limitation into a
Particular Affirmative (I).</p>

<p>(E) <i>Universal Negative</i>: This form of
proposition is converted by Simple Conversion.
In a Universal Negative <i>both terms are
distributed</i>. ("In universal propositions, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
<i>subject</i> is distributed;" "In negative propositions,
the <i>predicate</i> is distributed.") So
we may say "No cows are horses," and then
convert the proposition into "No horses are
cows." We simply convert one Universal
Negative (E) into another Universal Negative
(E).</p>

<p>(I) <i>Particular Affirmative</i>: This form of
proposition is converted by Simple Conversion.
For <i>neither term is distributed</i> in a
Particular Affirmative. ("In particular propositions,
the <i>subject</i> is <i>not</i> distributed. In affirmative
propositions, the <i>predicate</i> is <i>not</i>
distributed.") And neither term being distributed
in the convertend, it must not be distributed
in the converse. So from "Some
horses are males" we may by Simple Conversion
derive "Some males are horses." We
simply convert one Particular Affirmative (I),
into another Particular Affirmative (I).</p>

<p>(O) <i>Particular Negative</i>: This form of
proposition is converted by Contraposition or
Negation. We have given examples and illustrations
in the paragraph describing Conversion
by Contraposition. The Particular
Negative (I) is converted by contraposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
into a Particular Affirmative (I) which is then
simply converted into another Particular Affirmative
(I).</p>

<p>There are several minor processes or methods
of deriving judgments from each other,
or of making immediate inferences, but the
above will give the student a very fair idea
of the minor or more complete methods.</p>

<p><i>Exercise</i>: The following will give the student
good practice and exercise in the methods
of Conversion. It affords a valuable mental
drill, and tends to develop the logical faculties,
particularly that of Judgment. The student
should <i>convert</i> the following propositions,
according to the rules and examples
given in this chapter:</p>

<blockquote><p class="noin">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">1. All men are reasoning beings.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">2. Some men are blacksmiths.</span><br />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="chap">REASONING</p>


<p>In the preceding chapters we have seen that
in the group of mental processes involved in
the general process of Understanding, there
are several stages or steps, three of which we
have considered in turn, namely: (1) Abstraction;
(2) Generalization or Conception;
(3) Judgment. The <i>fourth</i> step, or stage, and
the one which we are now about to consider,
is that called Reasoning.</p>

<p><i>Reasoning</i> is that faculty of the mind whereby
we compare two Judgments, one with the
other, and from which comparison we are enabled
to form a third judgment. It is a form
of indirect or mediate comparison, whereas,
the ordinary Judgment is a form of immediate
or direct comparison. As, when we form a
Judgment, we compare two concepts and decide
upon their agreement or difference; so
in Reasoning we compare two Judgments and
from the comparison we draw or produce a
new Judgment. Thus, we may reason that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
particular dog "Carlo" is an animal, by the
following process:</p>

<p>(1) <i>All</i> dogs are animals; (2) Carlo is a
dog; therefore, (3) Carlo is an animal. Or,
in the same way, we may reason that a whale
is not a fish, as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <i>All</i> fish are cold-blooded animals; (2)
A whale is <i>not</i> a cold-blooded animal; therefore,
(3) A whale is <i>not</i> a fish.</p>

<p>In the above processes it will be seen that
the third and final Judgment is derived from a
comparison of the first two Judgments.
Brooks states the process as follows: "Looking
at the process more closely, it will be seen
that in inference in Reasoning involves a
comparison of relations. We infer the relation
of two objects from their relation to a
third object. We must thus grasp in the mind
two relations and from the comparison of
these two relations we infer a third relation.
The two relations from which we infer a third,
are judgments; hence, Reasoning may also be
defined as the process of deriving one judgment
from two other judgments. We compare
the two given judgments and from this
comparison derive the third judgment. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
constitutes a single step in Reasoning, and an
argument so expressed is called a <i>Syllogism</i>."</p>

<p>The <i>Syllogism</i> consists of three propositions,
the first two of which express the
grounds or basis of the argument and are
called the <i>premises</i>; the third expresses the
inference derived from a comparison of the
other two and is called the <i>conclusion</i>. We
shall not enter into a technical consideration
of the Syllogism in this book, as the subject is
considered in detail in the volume of this series
devoted to the subject of "Logic." Our concern
here is to point out the natural process
and course of Reasoning, rather than to consider
the technical features of the process.</p>

<p>Reasoning is divided into two general
classes, known respectively as (1) <i>Inductive
Reasoning</i>; (2) <i>Deductive Reasoning</i>.</p>

<p><i>Inductive Reasoning</i> is the process of arriving
at a general truth, law or principle from a
consideration of many particular facts and
truths. Thus, if we find that a certain thing is
true of a great number of particular objects,
we may infer that the same thing is true of <i>all</i>
objects of this particular kind. In one of the
examples given above, one of the judgments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
was that "all fish are cold-blooded animals,"
which general truth was arrived at by Inductive
Reasoning based upon the examination of
a great number of fish, and from thence assuming
that <i>all</i> fish are true to this general law
of truth.</p>

<p><i>Deductive Reasoning</i> is the reverse of Inductive
Reasoning, and is a process of arriving
at a particular truth from the assumption
of a general truth. Thus, from the assumption
that "all fish are cold-blooded animals,"
we, by Deductive Reasoning, arrive at the conclusion
that the particular fish before us must
be cold-blooded.</p>

<p>Inductive Reasoning proceeds upon the
basic principle that "<i>What is true of the many
is true of the whole</i>," while Deductive Reasoning
proceeds upon the basic principle that
"<i>What is true of the whole is true of its
parts</i>."</p>

<p>Regarding the principle of <i>Inductive Reasoning</i>,
Halleck says: "Man has to find out
through his own experience, or that of others,
the major premises from which he argues or
draws his conclusions. By induction, we examine
what seems to us a sufficient number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
individual cases. We then conclude that the
rest of these cases, which we have not examined,
will obey the same general law. The
judgment 'All men are mortal' was reached
by induction. It was observed that all past
generations of men had died, and this fact
warranted the conclusion that all men living
will die. We make that assertion as boldly as
if we had seen them all die. The premise, 'All
cows chew the cud,' was laid down after a certain
number of cows had been examined. If
we were to see a cow twenty years hence, we
should expect to find that she chewed the cud.
It was noticed by astronomers that, after a
certain number of days, the earth regularly
returned to the same position in its orbit, the
sun rose in the same place, and the day was of
the same length. Hence, the length of the year
and of each succeeding day was determined,
and the almanac maker now infers that the
same will be true of future years. He tells us
that the sun on the first of next December will
rise at a given time, although he cannot throw
himself into the future to verify the conclusion."</p>

<p>Brooks says regarding this principle: "This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
proposition is founded on our faith in the uniformity
of nature; take away this belief, and
all reasoning by induction fails. The basis of
induction is thus often stated to be <i>man's faith
in the uniformity of nature</i>. Induction has
been compared to a ladder upon which we ascend
from facts to laws. This ladder cannot
stand unless it has something to rest upon;
and this something is our faith in the constancy
of nature's laws."</p>

<p>There are two general ways of obtaining
our basis for the process of Inductive Reasoning.
One of these is called Perfect Induction
and the other Imperfect Induction. Perfect
Induction is possible only when we have had
the opportunity of examining every particular
object or thing of which the general idea is
expressed. For instance, if we could examine
every fish in the universe we would have the
basis of Perfect Induction for asserting the
general truth that "all fishes are cold-blooded."
But this is practically impossible
in the great majority of cases, and so we must
fall back upon more or less Imperfect Induction.
We must assume the general law from
the fact that it is seen to exist in a very great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
number of particular cases; upon the principle
that "What is true of the many is true of
the whole." As Halleck says regarding this:
"Whenever we make a statement such as, 'All
men are mortal,' without having tested each
individual case or, in other words, without
having seen every man die, we are reasoning
from <i>imperfect</i> induction. Every time a man
buys a piece of beef, a bushel of potatoes or a
loaf of bread, he is basing his action on inference
from imperfect induction. He believes
that beef, potatoes and bread will prove nutritious
food, although he has not actually tested
those special edibles before purchasing them.
They have hitherto been found to be nutritious
on trial and he argues that the same will prove
true of those special instances. Whenever
a man takes stock in a new national bank, a
manufactory or a bridge, he is arguing from
past cases that this special investment will
prove profitable. We instinctively believe in
the uniformity of nature; if we did not we
should not consult our almanacs. If sufficient
heat will cause phosphorus to burn today, we
conclude that the same result will follow tomorrow
if the circumstances are the same."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>But, it will be seen, much care must be exercised
in making observations, experiments and
comparisons, and in making generalizations.
The following general principles will give the
views of the authorities regarding this:</p>

<p>Atwater gives the two general rules:</p>

<p><i>Rule of Agreement</i>: "If, whenever a given
object or agency is present, without counteracting
forces, a given effect is produced, there
is a strong evidence that the object or agency
is the cause of the effect."</p>

<p><i>Rule of Disagreement</i>: "If when the supposed
cause is present the effect is present,
and when the supposed cause is absent the effect
is wanting, there being in neither case any
other agents present to effect the result, we
may reasonably infer that the supposed cause
is the real one."</p>

<p><i>Rule of Residue</i>: "When in any phenomena
we find a result remaining after the effects of
all known causes are estimated, we may attribute
it to a residual agent not yet reckoned."</p>

<p><i>Rule of Concomitant Variations</i>: "When a
variation in a given antecedent is accompanied
by a variation of a given consequent, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
are in some manner related as cause and
effect."</p>

<p>Atwater says, of the above rules, that
"whenever either of these criteria is found,
free from conflicting evidence, and especially
when several of them concur, the evidence is
clear that the cases observed are fair representatives
of the whole class, and warrant a
valid universal inductive conclusion."</p>

<p>We now come to what is known as Hypothesis
or Theory, which is an assumed general
principle&mdash;a conjecture or supposition
founded upon observed and tested facts.
Some authorities use the term "theory" in the
sense of "a verified hypothesis," but the two
terms are employed loosely and the usage
varies with different authorities. What is
known as "the probability of a hypothesis"
is the proportion of the number of facts it will
explain. The greater the number of facts it
will explain, the greater is its "probability."
A Hypothesis is said to be "verified" when
it will account for all the facts which are properly
to be referred to it. Some very critical
authorities hold that verification should also
depend upon there being no other possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
hypotheses which will account for the facts,
but this is generally considered an extreme
position.</p>

<p>A Hypothesis is the result of a peculiar
mental process which seems to act in the direction
of making a sudden anticipatory leap toward
a theory, after the mind has been saturated
with a great body of particular facts.
Some have spoken of the process as almost
<i>intuitive</i> and, indeed, the testimony of many
discoverers of great natural laws would lead
us to believe that the Subconscious region of
the mind is most active in making what La Place
has called "the great guess" of discovery
of principle. As Brooks says: "The forming
of hypotheses requires a suggestive mind, a
lively fancy, a philosophic imagination, that
catches a glimpse of the idea through the
form, or sees the law standing behind the
fact."</p>

<p>Thomson says: "The system of anatomy
which has immortalized the name of Oken, is
the consequence of a flash of anticipation
which glanced through his mind when he
picked up in a chance walk the skull of a deer,
bleached and disintegrated by the weather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and exclaimed, after a glance, 'It is part of a
vertebral column.' When Newton saw the
apple fall, the anticipatory question flashed
through his mind, 'Why do not the heavenly
bodies fall like this apple?' In neither case
had accident any important share; Newton
and Oken were prepared by the deepest previous
study to seize upon the unimportant fact
offered to them, and show how important it
might become; and if the apple and the deer-skull
had been wanting, some other falling
body, or some other skull, would have touched
the string so ready to vibrate. But in each
case there was a great step of anticipation;
Oken thought he saw the type of the whole
skeleton in a single vertebra, whilst Newton
conceived at once that the whole universe was
full of bodies tending to fall."</p>

<p>Passing from the consideration of Inductive
Reasoning to that of Deductive Reasoning we
find ourselves confronted with an entirely opposite
condition. As Brooks says: "The two
methods of reasoning are the reverse of each
other. One goes from particulars to generals;
the other from generals to particulars. One is
a process of analysis; the other is a process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
synthesis. One rises from facts to laws; the
other descends from laws to facts. Each is
independent of the other; and each is a valid
and essential method of inference."</p>

<p><i>Deductive Reasoning</i> is, as we have seen, dependent
upon the process of deriving a particular
truth from a general law, principle or
truth, upon the fundamental axiom that:
"What is true of the whole is true of its
parts." It is an analytical process, just as
Inductive Reasoning is synthetical. It is a
descending process, just as Inductive Reasoning
is ascending.</p>

<p>Halleck says of Deductive Reasoning: "After
induction has classified certain phenomena
and thus given us a major premise, we proceed
deductively to apply the inference to any
new specimen that can be shown to belong to
that class. Induction hands over to deduction
a ready-made major premise, <i>e.g.</i> '<i>All scorpions
are dangerous</i>.' Deduction takes this as
a fact, making no inquiry about its truth.
When a new object is presented, say a possible
scorpion, the only troublesome step is to decide
whether the object is really a scorpion.
This may be a severe task on judgment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
average inhabitant of the temperate zone
would probably not care to risk a hundred dollars
on his ability to distinguish a scorpion
from a centipede, or from twenty or thirty
other creatures bearing some resemblance to
a scorpion. Here there must be accurately
formed concepts and sound judgment must be
used in comparing them. As soon as we decide
that the object is really a scorpion, we
complete the deduction in this way:&mdash;'<i>All
scorpions are dangerous</i>; <i>this creature is a
scorpion</i>; <i>this creature is dangerous</i>.' The
reasoning of early life must be necessarily inductive.
The mind is then forming general
conclusions from the examination of individual
phenomena. Only after general laws have
been laid down, after objects have been classified,
after major premises have been formed,
can deduction be employed."</p>

<p>What is called <i>Reasoning by Analogy</i> is
really but a higher degree of Generalization.
It is based upon the idea that if two or more
things resemble each other in many particulars,
they are apt to resemble each other in
other particulars. Some have expressed the
principle as follows: "Things that have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
things in common have other things in common."
Or as Jevons states it: "The rule
for reasoning by analogy is that if two or more
things resemble each other in many points,
they will probably resemble each other also in
more points."</p>

<p>This form of reasoning, while quite common
and quite convenient, is also very dangerous.
It affords many opportunities for making
false inferences. As Jevons says: "In many
cases Reasoning by Analogy is found to be a
very uncertain guide. In some cases unfortunate
mistakes are committed. Children are
sometimes killed by gathering and eating poisonous
berries, wrongly inferring that they
can be eaten, because other berries, of a somewhat
similar appearance, have been found
agreeable and harmless. Poisonous toadstools
are occasionally mistaken for mushrooms,
especially by people not accustomed to
gather them.... There is no way in which
we can really assure ourselves that we are
arguing safely by analogy. The only rule that
can be given is this, <i>that the more things resemble
each other, the more likely is it that
they are the same in other respects, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
in points closely connected with those observed</i>."</p>

<p>Halleck says: "In argument or reasoning
we are much aided by the habit of searching
for hidden resemblances. We may here use
the term <i>analogy</i> in the narrower sense as a resemblance
of ratios. There is analogical relation
between autumnal frosts and vegetation
on the one hand, and death and human life on
the other. Frosts stand in the same relation
to vegetation that death does to life. The detection
of such a relation cultivates thought.
If we are to succeed in argument, we must develop
what some call a sixth sense for the detection
of such relations.... Many false
analogies are manufactured and it is excellent
thought training to expose them. The
majority of people think so little that they
swallow false analogies just as newly-fledged
robins swallow small stones dropped into their
open mouths.... The study of poetry may
be made very serviceable in detecting analogies
and cultivating the reasoning powers.
When the poet brings clearly to mind the
change due to death, using as an illustration
the caterpillar body transformed into the but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>terfly
spirit, moving with winged ease over
flowing meadows, he is cultivating our apprehension
of relations, none the less valuable
because they are beautiful."</p>

<p>There are certain studies which tend to develop
the power or faculty of <i>Inductive Reasoning</i>.
Any study which leads the mind to
consider classification and general principles,
laws or truth, will tend to develop the faculty
of deduction. Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy,
Biology and Natural History are particularly
adapted to develop the mind in this particular
direction. Moreover, the mind should
be directed to an inquiry into the <i>causes</i> of
<i>things</i>. Facts and phenomena should be observed
and an attempt should be made not
only to classify them, but also to discover general
principles moving them. Tentative or
provisional hypotheses should be erected and
then the facts re-examined in order to see
whether they support the hypotheses or theory.
Study of the processes whereby the great
scientific theories were erected, and the proofs
then adduced in support of them, will give the
mind the habit of thinking along the lines of
logical induction. The question ever in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
mind in Inductive Reasoning is "<i>Why?</i>" The
dominant idea in Inductive Reasoning is the
Search for Causes.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In regard to the pitfalls of Inductive Reasoning&mdash;the
fallacies, so-called, Hyslop says:
"It is not easy to indicate the inductive fallacies,
if it be even possible, in the formal
process of induction.... It is certain, however,
that in respect to the subject-matter of
the conclusion in inductive reasoning there are
some very definite limitations upon the right
to transcend the premises. We cannot infer
anything we please from any premises we
please. We must conform to certain definite
rules or principles. Any violation of them
will be a fallacy. These rules are the same as
those for material fallacies in deduction, so
that the fallacies of induction, whether they
are ever formal or not, are at least material;
that is they occur whenever equivocation and
presumption are committed. There are, then,
two simple rules which should not be violated.
(1) The subject-matter in the conclusion
should be of the same general kind as in the
premises. (2) The facts constituting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
premises must be accepted and must not be
fictitious."</p>

<p>One may develop his faculty or power of
<i>Deductive Reasoning</i> by pursuing certain lines
of study. The study of Mathematics, particularly
in its branch of Mental Arithmetic is
especially valuable in this direction. Algebra
and Geometry have long been known to exercise
an influence over the mind which gives to
it a logical trend and cast. The processes involved
in Geometry are akin to those employed
in Logical reasoning, and must necessarily
train the mind in this special direction.
As Brooks says: "So valuable is geometry as
a discipline that many lawyers and others review
their geometry every year in order to
keep the mind drilled to logical habits of thinking."
The study of Grammar, Rhetoric and
the Languages, are also valuable in the culture
and development of the faculty of Deductive
Reasoning. The study of Psychology and
Philosophy have value in this connection. The
study of Law is very valuable in creating logical
habits of thinking deductively.</p>

<p>But in the study of Logic we have possibly
the best exercise in the development and cul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>ture
of this particular faculty. As Brooks
well says: "The study of Logic will aid in the
development of the power of deductive reasoning.
It does this first by showing the method
by which we reason. To know how we reason,
to see the laws which govern the reasoning
process, to analyze the syllogism and see its
conformity to the laws of thought, is not only
an exercise of reasoning, but gives that knowledge
of the process that will be both a stimulus
and a guide to thought. No one can trace the
principles and processes of thought without
receiving thereby an impetus to thought. In
the second place, the study of logic is probably
even more valuable because it gives practice
in deductive thinking. This, perhaps, is its
principal value, since <i>the mind reasons instinctively
without knowing how it reasons</i>.
One can think without the knowledge of the
science of thinking, just as one can use
language correctly without a knowledge of
grammar; yet as the study of grammar improves
one's speech, so the study of logic cannot
but improve one's thought."</p>

<p>The study of the common <i>fallacies</i>, such as
"Begging the Question," "Reasoning in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Circle," etc., is particularly important to the
student, for when one realizes that such fallacies
exist, and is able to detect and recognize
them, he will avoid their use in framing his
own arguments, and will be able to expose
them when they appear in the arguments of
others.</p>

<p>The fallacy of "Begging the Question" consists
in assuming as a proven fact something
that has not been proven, or is not accepted as
proven by the other party to the argument. It
is a common trick in debate. The fact assumed
may be either the particular point to be
proved, or the premise necessary to prove it.
Hyslop gives the following illustration of this
fallacy: "<i>Good institutions should be united</i>;
Church and State are good institutions; therefore,
Church and State should be united."
The above syllogism seems reasonable at first
thought, but analysis will show that the major
premise "Good institutions should be united"
is a mere assumption without proof. Destroy
this premise and the whole reasoning fails.</p>

<p>Another form of fallacy, quite common, is
that called "Reasoning in a Circle," which
consists in assuming as proof of a proposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the proposition itself, as for instance, "This
man is a rascal, <i>because he is a rogue</i>; he is a
rogue, <i>because he is a rascal</i>." "We see
through glass, <i>because it is transparent</i>."
"The child is dumb, <i>because it has lost the
power of speech</i>." "He is untruthful, <i>because
he is a liar</i>." "The weather is warm, <i>because
it is summer</i>; it is summer, <i>because the
weather is warm</i>."</p>

<p>These and other fallacies may be detected
by a knowledge of Logic, and the perception
and detection of them strengthens one in his
faculty of Deductive Reasoning. The study
of the Laws of the Syllogism, in Logic, will
give to one a certain habitual sense of stating
the terms of his argument according to these
laws, which when acquired will be a long step
in the direction of logical thinking, and the culture
of the faculties of deductive reasoning.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter, we wish to call
your attention to a fact often overlooked by
the majority of people. Halleck well expresses
it as follows: "Belief is a mental state
which might as well be classed under <i>emotion</i>
as under thinking, for it combines both elements.
Belief is a part inference from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
known to the unknown, and part feeling and
emotion." Others have gone so far as to say
that the majority of people employ their intellects
merely to <i>prove</i> to themselves and others
that which they <i>feel to be true</i>, or <i>wish to
be true</i>, rather than to ascertain what is <i>actually
true</i> by logical methods. Others have said
that "men do not require <i>arguments</i> to convince
them; they want only <i>excuses</i> to justify
them in their feelings, desires or actions."
Cynical though this may seem, there is sufficient
truth in it to warn one to guard against
the tendency.</p>

<p>Jevons says, regarding the question of the
culture of logical processes of thought: "Monsieur
Jourdain, an amusing person in one of
Moliere's plays, expressed much surprise on
learning that he had been talking prose for
more than forty years without knowing it.
Ninety-nine people out of a hundred might be
equally surprised on hearing that they had
long been converting propositions, syllogizing,
falling into paralogisms, framing hypotheses
and making classifications with genera
and species. If asked if they were logicians,
they would probably answer, No. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
would be partly right; for I believe that a
large number even of educated persons have
no clear idea of what logic is. Yet, in a certain
way, every one must have been a logician since
he began to speak. It may be asked:&mdash;If we
cannot help being logicians, why do we need
logic books at all? The answer is that there
are logicians, and <i>logicians</i>. All persons are
logicians in some manner or degree; but unfortunately
many people are bad ones and
suffer harm in consequence. It is just the
same in other matters. Even if we do not
know the meaning of the name, we are all
<i>athletes</i> in some manner or degree. No one
can climb a tree or get over a gate without being
more or less an athlete. Nevertheless,
he who wishes to do these actions really well,
to have a strong muscular frame and thereby
to secure good health and personal safety,
as far as possible, should learn athletic
exercises."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="chap">CONSTRUCTIVE IMAGINATION</p>


<p>From the standpoint of the old psychology,
a chapter bearing the above title would be considered
quite out of place in a book on
Thought-Culture, the Imagination being considered
as outside the realm of practical
psychology, and as belonging entirely to the
idealistic phase of mental activities. The popular
idea concerning the Imagination also is
opposed to the "practical" side of its use. In
the public mind the Imagination is regarded
as something connected with idle dreaming
and fanciful mental imaging. Imagination
is considered as almost synonomous with
"Fancy."</p>

<p>But the New Psychology sees beyond this
negative phase of the Imagination and recognizes
the positive side which is essentially constructive
when backed up with a determined
will. It recognizes that while the Imagination
is by its very nature <i>idealistic</i>, yet these ideals
may be made real&mdash;these subjective pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
may be materialized objectively. The positive
phase of the Imagination manifests in planning,
designing, projecting, mapping out, and
in general in erecting the mental framework
which is afterward clothed with the material
structure of actual accomplishment. And, accordingly,
it has seemed to us that a chapter
on "Constructive Imagination" might well
conclude this book on Thought-Culture.</p>

<p>Halleck says: "It was once thought that the
imagination should be repressed, not cultivated,
that it was in the human mind like
weeds in a garden.... In this age there is no
mental power that stands more in need of cultivation
than the imagination. So practical
are its results that a man without it cannot
possibly be a good plumber. He must image
short cuts for placing his pipe. The image of
the direction to take to elude an obstacle must
precede the actual laying of the pipe. If he
fixes it before traversing the way with his
imagination, he frequently gets into trouble
and has to tear down his work. Some one has
said that the more imagination a blacksmith
has, the better will he shoe a horse. Every
time he strikes the red-hot iron, he makes it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
approximate to the image in his mind. Nor is
this image a literal copy of the horse's foot.
If there is a depression in that, the imagination
must build out a corresponding elevation
in the image, and the blows must make the iron
fit the image."</p>

<p>Brodie says: "Physical investigation, more
than anything else, helps to teach us the actual
value and right use of the imagination&mdash;of
that wondrous faculty, which, when left to
ramble uncontrolled, leads us astray into a
wilderness of perplexities and errors, a land
of mists and shadows; but which, properly
controlled by experience and reflection, becomes
the noblest attribute of man, the source
of poetic genius, the instrument of discovery
in science, without the aid of which Newton
would never have invented fluxions nor Davy
have decomposed the earths and alkalies,
nor would Columbus have found another
continent."</p>

<p>The Imagination is more than Memory, for
the latter merely reproduces the impressions
made upon it, while the Imagination gathers
up the material of impression and weaves new
fabrics from them or builds new structures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
from their separated units. As Tyndall well
said: "Philosophers may be right in affirming
that we cannot transcend experience; but we
can at all events carry it a long way from its
origin. We can also magnify, diminish, qualify
and combine experiences, so as to render
them fit for purposes entirely new. We are
gifted with the power of imagination and by
this power we can lighten the darkness which
surrounds the world of the senses. There are
tories, even in science, who regard imagination
as a faculty to be feared and avoided
rather than employed. But bounded and conditioned
by cooperant reason, imagination becomes
the mightiest instrument of the physical
discoverer. Newton's passage from a falling
apple to a falling moon was, at the outset,
a leap of the imagination."</p>

<p>Brooks says: "The imagination is a creative
as well as a combining power.... The
Imagination can combine objects of sense into
new forms, but it can do more than this. The
objects of sense are, in most cases, merely the
materials with which it works. The imagination
is a plastic power, moulding the things of
sense into new forms to express its ideals; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
it is these ideals that constitute the real products
of the imagination. The objects of the
material world are to it like clay in the hands
of the potter; it shapes them into forms according
to its own ideals of grace and beauty....
He, who sees no more than a mere combination
in these creations of the imagination,
misses the essential element and elevates into
significance that which is merely incidental."</p>

<p>Imagination, in some degree or phase, must
come before voluntary physical action and
conscious material creation. Everything that
has been created by the hand of man has first
been created in the <i>mind</i> of man by the exercise
of the Imagination. Everything that man
has wrought has first existed in his mind as an
<i>ideal</i>, before his hands, or the hands of others,
wrought it into material <i>reality</i>. As Maudsley
says: "It is certain that in order to execute
consciously a voluntary act we must have in
the mind a conception of the aim and purpose
of the act." Kay says: "It is as serving to
guide and direct our various activities that
mental images derive their chief value and importance.
In anything that we purpose or intend
to do, we must first of all have an idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
or image of it in the mind, and the more clear
and correct the image, the more accurately
and efficiently will the purpose be carried out.
We cannot exert an act of volition without
having in the mind an idea or image of what
we will to effect."</p>

<p>Upon the importance of a scientific use of
the Imagination in every-day life, the best authorities
agree. Maudsley says: "We cannot
do an act voluntarily unless we know what we
are going to do, and we cannot know exactly
what we are going to do until we have taught
ourselves to do it." Bain says: "By aiming at
a new construction, we must clearly conceive
what is aimed at. Where we have a very distinct
and intelligible model before us, we are
in a fair way to succeed; in proportion as the
ideal is dim and wavering we stagger and miscarry."
Kay says: "A clear and accurate
idea of what we wish to do, and how it is to be
effected, is of the utmost value and importance
in all the affairs of life. A man's conduct
naturally shapes itself according to the ideas
in his mind, and nothing contributes more to
his success in life than having a high ideal and
keeping it constantly in view. Where such is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the case one can hardly fail in attaining it.
Numerous unexpected circumstances will be
found to conspire to bring it about, and even
what seemed at first hostile may be converted
into means for its furtherance; while by having
it constantly before the mind he will be
ever ready to take advantage of any favoring
circumstances that may present themselves."</p>

<p>Simpson says: "A passionate desire and an
unwearied will can perform impossibilities, or
what seem to be such, to the cold and feeble."
Lytton says: "Dream, O youth, dream manfully
and nobly, and thy dreams shall be
prophets." Foster says: "It is wonderful
how even the casualities of life seem to bow to
a spirit that will not bow to them, and yield to
subserve a design which they may, in their
first apparent tendency, threaten to frustrate.
When a firm decisive spirit is recognized it is
curious to see how space clears around a man
and leaves him room and freedom." Tanner
says: "To believe firmly is almost tantamount
in the end to accomplishment." Maudsley
says: "Aspirations are often prophecies, the
harbingers of what a man shall be in a condition
to perform." Macaulay says: "It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
related of Warren Hastings that when only
seven years old there arose in his mind a
scheme which through all the turns of his
eventful life was never abandoned." Kay
says: "When one is engaged in seeking for a
thing, if he keep the image of it clearly before
the mind, he will be very likely to find it, and
that too, probably, where it would otherwise
have escaped his notice." Burroughs says:
"No one ever found the walking fern who did
not have the walking fern in his mind. A person
whose eye is full of Indian relics picks
them up in every field he walks through. They
are quickly recognized because the eye has
been commissioned to find them."</p>

<p>Constructive Imagination differs from the
phases of the faculty of Imagination which are
akin to "Fancy," in a number of ways, the
chief points of difference being as follows:</p>

<p>The Constructive Imagination is always exercised
in the pursuance of <i>a definite intent
and purpose</i>. The person so using the faculty
starts out with the idea of accomplishing certain
purposes, and with the direct intent of
thinking and planning in that particular direction.
The fanciful phase of the Imagina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>tion,
on the contrary, starts with no definite
intent or purpose, but proceeds along the line
of mere idle phantasy or day-dreaming.</p>

<p>The Constructive Imagination <i>selects its
material</i>. The person using the faculty in this
manner abstracts from his general stock of
mental images and impressions those particular
materials which fit in with his general intent
and purpose. Instead of allowing his
imagination to wander around the entire field
of memory, or representation, he deliberately
and voluntarily selects and sets apart only
such objects as seem to be conducive to his
general design or plan, and which are logically
associated with the same.</p>

<p>The Constructive Imagination operates
upon the lines of <i>logical thought</i>. One so
using the faculty subjects his mental images,
or ideas, to his <i>thinking faculties</i>, and proceeds
with his imaginative constructive work
along the lines of Logical Thought. He goes
through the processes of Abstraction, Generalization
or Conception, Judgment and the
higher phases of Reasoning, in connection
with his general work of Constructive Imagination.
Instead of having the objects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
thought before him in material form, he has
them represented to his mind <i>in ideal form</i>,
and he works upon his material in that shape.</p>

<p>The Constructive Imagination is <i>voluntary</i>&mdash;under
the control and direction of the will.
Instead of being in the nature of a dream depending
not upon the will or reason, it is directly
controlled not only by reason but also
by the will.</p>

<p>The Constructive Imagination, like every
other faculty of the mind, may be developed
and cultivated by Use and Nourishment. It
must be exercised in order to develop its mental
muscle; and it must be supplied with nourishment
upon which it may grow. Drawing,
Composing, Designing and Planning along
any line is calculated to give to this faculty the
exercise that it requires. The reading of the
right kind of literature is also likely to lead the
faculty into activity by inspiring it with ideals
and inciting it by example.</p>

<p>The mind should be supplied with the
proper material for the exercise of this faculty.
As Halleck says: "Since the imagination
has not the miraculous power necessary
to create something out of nothing, the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
essential thing is to get the proper perceptional
material in proper quantity. If a child
has enough blocks, he can build a castle or a
palace. Give him but three blocks, and his
power of combination is painfully limited.
Some persons wonder why their imaginative
power is no greater, when they have only a few
accurate ideas." It thus follows that the active
use of the Perceptive faculties will result
in storing away a quantity of material, which,
when represented or reproduced by the Memory,
will give to the Constructive Imagination
the material it requires with which to build.
The greater the general knowledge of the person,
the greater will be his store of material
for this use. This knowledge need not necessarily
be acquired at first hand from personal
observation, but may also be in the nature of
information acquired from the experience of
others and known through their conversation,
writings, etc.</p>

<p>The necessity of forming clear concepts is
very apparent when we come to exercise the
Constructive Imaginative. Unless we have
clear-cut ideas of the various things concerned
with the subject before us, we cannot focus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
imagination clearly upon its task. The general
ideas should be clearly understood and
the classification should be intelligent. Particular
things should be clearly seen in "the
mind's eye;" that is, the power of visualization
or forming mental images should be cultivated
in this connection. One may improve
this particular faculty by either writing a description
of scenes or particular things we
have seen, or else by verbally describing them
to others. As Halleck says: "An attempt at a
clear-cut oral description of something to another
person will often impress ourselves and
him with the fact that our mental images are
hazy, and that the first step toward better description
consists in improving them."</p>

<p>Tyndall has aptly stated the importance of
visualizing one's ideas and particular concepts,
as follows: "How, for example, are we
to lay hold of the physical basis of light since,
like that of life itself, it lies entirely without
the domain of the senses?... Bring your
imaginations once more into play and figure
a series of sound-waves passing through air.
Follow them up to their origin, and what do
you there find? A definite, tangible, vibrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
body. It may be the vocal chords of a human
being, it may be an organ-pipe, or it may be a
stretched string. Follow in the same manner
a train of ether waves to their source, remembering
at the same time that your ether is matter,
dense, elastic and capable of motions subject
to and determined by mechanical laws.
What then do you expect to find as the source
of a series of ether waves? Ask your imagination
if it will accept a vibrating multiple
proportion&mdash;a numerical ratio in a state of
oscillation? I do not think it will. You cannot
crown the edifice by this abstraction. The
scientific imagination which is here authoritative,
demands as the origin and cause of a
series of ether waves a particle of vibrating
matter quite as definite, though it may be
excessively minute, as that which gives origin
to a musical sound. Such a particle we name
an atom or a molecule. I think the seeking intellect,
when focused so as to give definition
without penumbral haze, is sure to realize this
image at the last."</p>

<p>By repeatedly exercising the faculty of
Imagination upon a particular idea, we add
power and clearness to that idea. This is but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
another example of the familiar psychological
principle expressed by Carpenter as follows:
"The continued concentration of attention
upon a certain idea gives it a dominant
power." Kay says: "Clearness and accuracy
of image is only to be obtained by repeatedly
having it in the mind, or by repeated action of
the faculty. Each repeated act of any of the
faculties renders the mental image of it more
clear and accurate than the preceding, and in
proportion to the clearness and accuracy of
the image will the act itself be performed easily,
readily, skillfully. The course to be pursued,
the point to be gained, the amount of
effort to be put forth, become more and more
clear to the mind. It is only from what we
have done that we are able to judge what we
can do, and understand how it is to be effected.
When our ideas or conceptions of what we can
do are not based on experience, they become
fruitful sources of error."</p>

<p>Galton says: "There is no doubt as to the
utility of the visualizing faculty where it is
duly subordinated to the higher intellectual
operations. A visual image is the most perfect
form of mental representation wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the shape, position and relation of objects in
space are concerned. It is of importance in
every handicraft and profession where design
is required. The best workmen are those who
visualize the whole of what they propose to do
before they take a tool in their hands."</p>

<p>Kay says: "If we bear in mind that every
sensation or idea must form an image in the
mind before it can be perceived or understood,
and that every act of volition is preceded by
its image, it will be seen that images play an
important part in all our mental operations.
According to the nature of the ideas or images
which he entertains will be the character and
conduct of the man. The man tenacious of
purpose is the man who holds tenaciously certain
ideas; the flighty man is he who cannot
keep one idea before him for any length of
time, but constantly flits from one to another;
the insane man is he who entertains insane
ideas often, it may be, on only one or two subjects.
We may distinguish two great classes
of individuals according to the prevailing
character of their images. There are those
in whose mind sensory images predominate,
and those whose images are chiefly such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
tend to action. Those of the former class are
observant, often thoughtful, men of judgment
and, it may be, of learning; but if they have
not also the active faculty in due force, they
will fail in giving forth or in turning to proper
account their knowledge or learning, and instances
of this kind are by no means uncommon.
The man, on the other hand, who has
ever in his mind images of things to be done,
is the man of action and enterprise. If he is
not also an observant and thoughtful man, if
his mind is backward in forming images of
what is presented to it from without, he will
be constantly liable to make mistakes."</p>

<p>Galton says of the faculty of visualization:
"Our bookish and wordy education tends to
repress this valuable gift of nature. A faculty
that is of importance in all technical and
artistic occupations, that gives accuracy to
our perceptions and justness to our generalizations,
is starved by lazy disuse, instead of
being cultivated judiciously in such a way as
will, on the whole, bring the best return. I believe
that a serious study of the best method
of developing and using this faculty without
prejudice to the practice of abstract thought in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
symbols, is one of the many pressing desiderata
in the yet unformed science of education."</p>

<p>This consideration of the faculty of, and
culture of, the Imagination, may appropriately
be concluded by the following quotation
from Prof. Halleck, which shows the danger
of misuse and abuse of this important faculty.
The aforesaid well-known authority says:
"From its very nature, the imagination is
peculiarly liable to abuse. The common practices
of day-dreaming or castle-building are
both morally and physically unhealthful. We
reach actual success in life by slow, weary
steps. The day-dreamer attains eminence
with one bound. He is without trouble a victorious
general on a vast battlefield, an orator
swaying thousands, a millionaire with every
amusement at his command, a learned man
confounding the wisest, a president, an emperor
or a czar. After reveling in these imaginative
sweets, the dry bread of actual toil
becomes exceedingly distasteful. It is so
much easier to live in regions where everything
comes at the magic wand of fancy. Not
infrequently these castle-builders abandon effort
in an actual world. Success comes too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
slow for them. They become speculators or
gamblers, and in spite of all their grand
castles, gradually sink into utter nonentities
in the world of action.... The young
should never allow themselves to build any
imaginative castle, unless they are willing by
hard effort to try to make that castle a reality.
They must be willing to take off their coats,
go into the quarries of life, chisel out the
blocks of the stone, and build them with much
toil into the castle walls. If castle-building
is merely the formation of an ideal, which we
show by our effort that we are determined to
attain, then all will be well."</p>

<p>It will be seen that, in reality, the Cultivation
of the Imagination is rather the training
and intelligent direction of that faculty, instead
of the development of its power. The
majority of people have the faculty of Imagination
well developed, but to them it is largely
an untrained, fanciful self-willed faculty. Cultivation
is needed in the direction of bringing
it under the guidance of the reason, and control
by the will. Thought-Culture in general
will do much for the Imagination, for the very
processes employed in the development and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
cultivation of the various other faculties of
the mind will also tend to bring the Imagination
into subjection and under control, instead
of allowing it to remain the wild, fanciful irresponsible
faculty that it is in the majority of
cases. Use the faculty of Imagination as a
faculty of <i>Thought</i>, instead of a thing of
<i>Fancy</i>. Attach it to the <i>Intellect</i> instead of to
the <i>Emotions</i>. Harness it up with the other
faculties of Thought, and your chariot of Understanding
and Attainment will reach the
goal far sooner than under the old arrangement.
Establish harmony between Intellect
and Imagination, and you largely increase the
power and achievements of both.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
