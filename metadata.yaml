description: Though he typically wrote under the guise of anonymity, using an array
  of pseudonyms and pen names, author and thinker William Walker Atkinson was an enormously
  influential figure in the ""New Thought"" movement. In fact, he is often credited
  with being the original source of the ideas that later coalesced under the term
  ""the Law of Attraction."" The volume Thought-Culture offers an array of practical
  tips for those who are interested in improving their mental acuity.
